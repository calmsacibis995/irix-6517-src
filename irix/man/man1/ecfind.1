.SH NAME
\f3ecfind\f1 \- report processes using process-based event counters
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3ecfind\f1
[\f3\-tv\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ecfind
may be used on systems with R10000 or R12000 processors to
discover which processes, if any, are currently using the
process-based hardware event counter mechanisms, e.g. executing
an application under the control of
.BR perfex (1).
.PP
This is most useful in situations where the
global event counters cannot be enabled with
.BR ecadmin (1)
due to concurrent use of the process-based event counters.
.PP
.B ecfind
uses
.BR icrash (1)
on the running kernel, and hence must be run as root.
.PP
The options to 
.I ecfind
are as follows;
.PP
.TP 5
\f3\-t\f1
By default
.B ecfind
reports processes using a subset of the output from
.BR ps (1)
with the options
.BR \-ef .
The
.B \-t
(or terse) option produces a more spartan output format with
just the process id and the command name reported.
.TP 5
\f3\-v\f1
More verbose output, with the details of intermediate data used
to identify the processes of interest.
This is most useful for debugging any cases in which
.B ecfind
does not correctly identify the target processes.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR ecadmin (1),
.BR perfex (1),
.BR speedshop (1)
and
.BR r10k_counters (5).
