* KBD - generalized string composition / translation module
*
*		INCLUDE:KBD
*
* (Older versions had a #C, but all static allocation has been removed.)
*
* NKBDU is the maximum number of tables a user may have active at
* one time in either direction (to reduce tlink-hogging).  Must be at
* least 2.
*
* ZUMEM is the maximum core storage allowed per user for private tables.
* Should be kept low (unless the kernel is paged).
*
* KBDTIME is the default value for "timed" tables.  It must be between
* 5 and 400 (if not, it is forced to the nearest limit); it represents
* the number of ticks allowed for a timed sequence to be accepted.
