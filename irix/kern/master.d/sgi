/*
 * This is the thread configuration mechanism. The thread is identified
 * by its name string. At the moment, there are three things you can
 * specify; the priority, stack size, and a CPU upon which it must run.
 *
 * If the thread you specify isn't in the system, nothing will happen.
 *
 * If you don't specify a thread here, it will be configured with the
 * the default values which will depend on what kind of thread it is.
 *
 * Kernel code depends on this list being null terminated (and, therefore,
 * a valid entry cannot have a NULL name field.  This file may be
 * automatically generated, but it can always be edited by hand.
