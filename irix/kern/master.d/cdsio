/* Older systems used a cabling scheme which makes it impossible to
 *	open a port with NDELAY and 'hardware flowcontrol' using the
 *	/dev/ttyf* name.  The difference between old and new cables
 *	is a transposition of DCD and DSR or of pin 6 and pin 8 on a 25-pin
 *	connector.  The cable in question is the one within the IRIS, not
 *	the cable outside connecting the IRIS to the modems.  Old cabling
 *	can be converted to new by transposing pins 6 (PC-AT standard DSR)
 *	and 1 (PC-AT standard DCD) on each of the connecters of the cable
 *	harness connected to the serial board, at the board-end.  The new
 *	cable connects pin 1 of the board to pin 1 of the external
 *	connector, and pin 6 of the board to pin 8 of the external
 *	connector.
 *
 *	All cables in the system must be old or new.  Mixing does not work.
