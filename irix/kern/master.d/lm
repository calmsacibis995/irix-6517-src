/* This variable tells the system how to handle level 7 VME interrupts.
 * If true, the kernel assumes that the location monitor is in effect,
 * and will clear the interrupt without sending a VME IACK.
 * If false, the kernel will treat level 7 interrupts just like any other
 * VME interrupt.
 *
 * Note that the variable is only defined if the lm module exists.  To
 * enable building of a kernel without the lm module, the kernel calls
 * lm_is_enabled() to check the state of this variable.  If the driver
 * is not installed, the stub above will be used instead of a routine
 * supplied in the lm module.
