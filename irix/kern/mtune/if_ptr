* The following two parameters set the maximum number of
* transmitting and receiving slots between the driver and
* an adapter. It must be defined within the range of [8, 32].
* More slots requires more memory for each adapter.

* To change them for each adpater, mtrconfig(1M) should be used

* Broadcast bits for route discovery EXPLORER frames:
*
* 0x8000 - use All-route Broadcast, nonbroadcast return.
* 0xc000 - use Single-route Broadcast, All-Route broadcast return.
* 0xe000 - use Single-route Broadcast, nonbroadcast return.

mtr_bc_mask 0x8000
* customized mtu:
*
*      4472    - max MTU for 4 Mbit ring.
*      17800   - max MTU for 16 Mbit ring.
*
* However, many bridges limit the max frame size to 4472, so the
* default MTU used is 4472. If there are no bridges in the tokenring
* network topology, mtr_mtu can be increased, subject to the limits
* specified above, for a higher throughput.
*
mtr_mtu  4472
* customized broadcast addresses:
*
* When receiving, the board accepts all broadcast addresses
* specified by the ANSI 802.5 spec.
*
* But some PC/bridge implementations honor only 0xC000FFFFFFFF,
* so when transmitting the destination broadcast address will
* be set as specified by mtr_batype below.
*
*      type 1 -> use 0xc000ffffffff
*      type 2 -> use 0xffffffffffff
