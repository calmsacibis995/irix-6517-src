* ipg_delay is the number of usecs in addition to the 802.3 inter-
*    packet gap.  Turning on causes MAC layer behavior to change
*    w/ respect to the carrier transmission after deferal periods;
*    when on, it will violate the 802.3 spec by checking for carrier
*    after the IPG + delay on prior deferred packets.  Default is
*    OFF (0)
ec_ipg_delay		 0		      0		     24

* xpg_delay when on will prevent streaming of packets interleaved
*    by the minimum 9.6us IPG.  When > 0, each packet transmission
*    will be seperated by the machine's interrupt latency + the delay
*    in usecs specified.  Default is OFF (0)
ec_xpg_delay		 0		      0		     50

* 16coll_retry is the number of successive times that the driver
*    will attempt to retransmit a packet that could not get through
*    the interface because of experiencing 16 consecutive collisions.
*    Beyond this limit, the packet will be dropped and higher protocol
*    layers are responsible for retransmitting.
ec_16coll_retry		 2		      0		      5

* Number of RCV descriptors for each ec2 interface:
* 63 is a hard coded upper bound for both of these.
