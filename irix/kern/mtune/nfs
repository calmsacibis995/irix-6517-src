* lockmgr - lock manager client

* portmap_timeout ==> portmapper query timeout in 1/10 seconds
* sm_timeout ==> status monitor communication timeout in 1/10 seconds
* GraceWaitTime ==> NLM grace period wait time in seconds
* first_retry ==> retries on first contacting the local/remote port mapper
* normal_retry ==> retries on later attempts to contact port mapper
* max_nfs_clients ==> maximum size of nfs client handle table. 
* max_nsd_clients ==> maximum size of nsd client handle table.
* max_xnfs_clients ==> maximum size of nfs client handle table for extended
*                      attributes.

* Decreasing normal & working timeouts can hurt system performance dramatically
