* xfs_nfs_io_units:
*
* If an NFS write occurs beyond EOF, XFS will zero-fill the range
* between the current EOF and the start of the write if the size
* of the range is less than or equal to "xfs_nfs_io_units" write I/O
* units (typically 16K for NFSv2 and 32K for NFSv3)
*
* the smaller the value, the greater the chance of excess fragmentation
* due to out-of-order NFS writes.  The default number may need to be
* increased if the number of nfsd's (usual default is 4) on the system
* is increased.
*
* xfs_refcache_percent:
*
* the xfs_refcache_percent variable specifies the size of the XFS
* inode reference cache as a percentage of the value of ncsize.
* Note however that the minimum reference cache size is 100 entries.
* If a value of xfs_refcache_percent is specified that would cause the
* cache size to drop below 100, the cache size is silently set to 100.
