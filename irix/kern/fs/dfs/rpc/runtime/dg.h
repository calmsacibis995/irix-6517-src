/*
 * Some terminology conventions in procedure naming.
 *
 * Below, by "collection" ("C") we mean a table of some sort; collections
 * are composed of "elements".  The Client Connection Table (CCT) is
 * an example of a collection; a client connection table entry (CCTE)
 * is an example of an element.  By "object" ("O") we mean some data
 * structure.  A call handle is an example of an object.
 *
 * C_lookup
 *      means look something up in the "C" collection.  If a matching
 *      element is found, return the element.  Otherwise return NULL.
 * 
 * C_insert 
 *      means insert an element into the "C" collection.
 *
 * C_remove
 *      means remove an element from the "C" collection.
 * 
 * C_get
 *      means look something up in the "C" collection.  If a matching
 *      element is found, return the element.  Otherwise, create an
 *      appropriate element, insert it in the collection and return the
 *      element.
 *
 * O_release
 *      means release a reference to an "O" object.  (If "O" refers to
 *      a collection, the object is an element in the collection previously
 *      obtained via either "C_lookup" or "C_get".)  See "Reference Counts"
 *      comment below.
 * 
 * O_reference  
 *      means establish another reference to an "O" object.  (If "O"
 *      refers to a collection, the object is an element in the collection
 *      previously obtained via either "C_lookup" or "C_get".)  See
 *      "Reference Counts" comment below.
 * 
 * O_alloc
 *      means allocate and return (a reference to) an "O" object.
 *      
 * O_free
 *      means deallocate an "O" object.
 *      
 * O_init
 *      means initialize an "O" object.
 *      
 * O_reinit
 *      means re-initialize an "O" object.
 *
 * In general "O_foo" operates on an "O".  This is the "object-oriented"
 * approach.  However, we don't belabor it -- some procedures are just
 * not best considered as operations on objects; i.e., they're procedures,
 * not operations (messages, in the Smalltalk sense).  For just procedures,
 * we use English-oriented names (whatever that means).
 */

/* ========================================================================= */

/* 
 * Reference Counts
 * ----------------
 * 
 * Various data structures have a reference count field named ".refcnt".
 * Reference counting augments (does not replace) mutex locking in situations
 * where (a) a lock would have to be held for "too long", (b) the data
 * structure is heap allocated, and (c) the data structure should not be
 * freed until all the logical users of the structure are done with it.
 * The paradigmatic code sequence that requires reference counts is:
 * 
 *      (1) Lock data structure
 *      (2) Look at interesting parts of structure
 *      (3) Do something for a long time
 *      (4) Look at interesting parts of structure
 *      (5) Unlock structure
 * 
 * We avoid the "holding a lock for too long" problem in the above code
 * by doing:
 * 
 *      (1) Lock data structure
 *      (2) Look at interesting parts of structure
 *      (3) "reference" 
 *      (4) Unlock structure
 *      (5) Do something for a long time
 *      (6) Lock data structure
 *      (7) Look at interesting parts of structure
 *      (8) "release"
 * 
 * "Reference" means increment the structure's reference count; "release"
 * means decrement the structure's reference count and if the count becomes
 * zero then free the structure, otherwise just unlock the structure.  In
 * this model no one directly calls a "free" function; they call a "release"
 * function instead (which in turn does a "free" if the reference count
 * drops to zero).
 * 
 * Note that the code above is really an execution flow and does not
 * necessarily reflect code structure.  I.e., steps (1)-(4) might be in
 * one place, step (5) in another, and steps (6)-(8) in yet another.  The
 * basic idea is this:  If you establish a reference to a structure (e.g.,
 * by embedding a pointer to the structure in some other structure, or if
 * you "pass" a pointer to another thread somehow) and you unlock the
 * structure and you want the structure to be there later, you must increment
 * the reference count.
 * 
 * Routines that look things up and return references to entries should
 * return with the entry locked and the reference count already incremented.
 * 
 * To establish or release a reference or to free a structure, you must
 * have the structure locked.
 *
 * Since releasing a reference will unlock or free a structure, you must
 * not use the reference after a release.

 * In some cases it is inconvenient/wasteful to be dynamically allocating

 * this buffer each time a packet is received on a different NAF.  To
 * avoid this situation, we define an RPC address structure that should
 * be large enough to hold the largest network address we expect to see.
 * The size of the actual address part of this type is determined by the

/*
 * Packet header structure.
 *
 * Alignment
 * ---------
 * All the scalar fields are "naturally aligned" -- i.e. aligned 0 MOD
 * min(8, sizeof(field)).  This is done for maximum portability and
 * efficiency of field reference.  Note also that the header is a integral
 * multiple of 8 bytes in length.  This ensures that (assuming the pkt
 * is 8-byte aligned in memory), the start of the data area is 8-byte
 * aligned.  (8 bytes is the size of the largest scalar we support.)
 *
 * Wrapping
 * --------
 * Sequence and fragment numbers can wrap.  Non-equality comparisons
 * between such objects must use the comparison macros below.
 * 
 * Fragment numbers
 * ----------------
 * In requests, "fragnum" is the number of the frag sent.  In facks,
 * "fragnum" is the number of the highest in-order frag received; if
 * frag 0 hasn't been received, the fack contains a "fragnum" of 0xffff.
 * 
 *
 * Packet lengths
 * --------------
 * Packet bodies must have lengths that are 0 MOD 8, except for the last
 * fragment in a request or response.  (Since the packet header is also
 * of a length that is 0 MOD 8, this means that the entire packet will
 * be of a length that is 0 MOD 8.)  Rationale: The stub/runtime interface
 * demands that we return data buffers whose length is 0 MOD 8.  (This
 * means that no NDR scalar will ever be split across buffers, a convenient
 * property for the stubs.)  We make it easy to meet this demand by making
 * packets of length 0 MOD 8, meaning we can simply return (pointer to)
 * packets as received data buffers to the stubs.
 * 
 * Storage layout
 * --------------
 * Not all C compilers (esp. those for machines whose smallest addressible
 * unit is not 8 bits) pack the "rpc_dg_pkt_hdr_t" structure "correctly"
 * (i.e. into a storage layout that can be overlayed on a vector of bytes
 * that make up a packet that's just come off the wire).  Thus, on some
 * machines "rpc_dg_pkt_hdr_t" can not simply be used on incoming packets
 * (or used to set up outgoing packets).  We call machines that have
 * this problem "mispacked header machines".
 * 
 * To fix this problem, on mispacked header machine, when a packet arrives
 * we expand the header bits so they correspond to the actual storage
 * layout of "rpc_dg_pkt_hdr_t".  Analogously, before sending a packet,
 * we contract the header bits.

/*
 * Fack packet body structure. 
 *
 * Pre-v2 NCK facks always had zero length bodies.  V2 fack bodies
 * contain useful information.
 *
 * The following two values related to packet size can appear in a fack
 * body:
 *
 * max_tsdu:      The size of the largest transport protocol data unit
 *                (TPDU) that can be passed through the local transport
 *                service interface (i.e., transport API).  The fack
 *                sender can never process datagrams larger than this.
 *
 * max_frag_size: The size of the largest fragment that can be
 *                sent/received by the fack sender.
 *                (AES spells it as max_path_tpdu.)
 *
 * The sender of a fack puts its local idea of these two values into
 * the fack body, to help the other side determine what fragment
 * size to use. The fack sender is saying "Don't ever send me
 * fragments larger than 'max_tsdu'" and "I think you probably don't
 * want to send me fragments larger than 'max_frag_size' because I
 * can't process it".
 *
 * The receiver of a fack compares the two values with the locally
 * determined values (in the receiver's call xmitq) and, if
 * appropriate, the xmitq's fragment size, 'snd_frag_size', is
 * increased. (Currently, we play it safe by taking the minimum the
 * two values in the fack and the two locally computed values.)
 *
 * The serial_num field is taken from the packet header of the packet
 * that induced the ack.  Since each packet is given a unique serial
 * number prior to transmission, the sender can always determine exactly
 * which packet induced the ack.  Serial numbers play the role of logical
 * clocks, which allow the sender to determine which packets should have
 * been received given an ack for a packet sent at time n.  This is 
 * especially useful in the face of multiple retransmissions, when 
 * fragment numbers don't provide any ordering information.
 *
 * The selective ack fields provide information about what additional
 * packets were received in addition to the fragment explicitly mentioned
 * in this fack (N).  If included, each bit in the mask (B) corresponds
 * to whether of not fragment N+B was received.  Note that the low order
 * bit in the first mask will always be 0, since atleast one fragment
 * is missing, and N will always be the number of the fragment before
 * the first known missing fragment.
 *
 * Note that nocall packets can also have fack bodies.  (Pre-DCE 1.0.2
 * nocall packets always had zero length bodies.)  This is to remedy
 * a couple of flaws in the original protocol which precluded (a) sending
 * facks in response to single-packet requests, and (b) sending facks
 * in response to pings (in requests of any size).  Older clients will
 * ignore the fack body that appears in nocall packets.

 * of the "receive" is the address of the forwarder, not the original

 * the body of the packet to be forwarded is not full and the case where
 * it IS full.  In the non-full case, the forwarder inserts the original
 * client address at the front of the body of the packet to be forwarded.
 * (The original body is slid down.)  The rpc_c_dg_pf_forwarded bit is
 * set in the header.  When the server receives such a packet, it just
 * picks up the address from the body and slides the real body back up.
 * 
 * In the case of a full packet body, the packet must be forwarded in
 * two packets.  The forwarder makes body of the first packet contains
 * only the original client address and sets the rpc_c_dg_pf2_forwarded2
 * flag.  The body of the second packet is the original packet body;

 * the server stub.  The server stub can then begin monitoring the client
 * by registering a rundown function pointer through a call to the
 * monitor_liveness() routine.  A NULL rundown function pointer
 * indicates that the client is not currently being monitored.
 *
 * Note that several SCTEs may point to a single client_rep.  Since the

/*
 * Transmit packet queue (XMITQ or XQ)
 *
 * This is a queue of structs describing packets (fragments) that can
 * (and may already have been) transmitted and are awaiting receipt
 * acknowledgement.  Receipt acknowledgements can come in several flavors
 * depending on whether you are a client or a server and whether there
 * are fragments.  Adaquate acknowledgements are one of the following
 * packets: fack, working, response, ack.  The key here is that if there
 * is data on the xq then it must be there because it can't yet be tossed;
 * it's awaiting an ack.
 *
 * All necessary encryption operations (on either just the header [for
 * integrity] or on the header and the body [for privacy]) have been
 * performed on the packets in this queue.  This queue is constructed
 * using the information present in a XMIT IO Vector Queue.  Creation
 * of Packet Queue Elements is controlled by resource consumption /
 * transmit window availability.  Since encryption is based on a packet
 * worth of data (including a complete pkt header), encryption must be
 * delayed until the complete packet is "assembled".
 * 
 * Periodically, some of the "packets" on the queue may need to be
 * retransmitted because they've timed out.  They may also need to be
 * retransmitted in response to a nocall or fack receipt.  After some
 * period of no apparent acknowledgement arrivals you have to just give
 * up.
 *
 * As fragment acknowledgements are received, the packet queue elements
 * may be freed.  The transmit window will be adjusted, thereby allowing
 * more data to be transmitted.
 *
 * Some background on packet sizes:  ".max_tsdu" is our local computation
 * of how large a packet we can fit through our local tranport API.
 * ".max_path_tpdu" is our local computation of the largest packet that
 * we can send to our peer without incurring fragmentation.
 * ".max_pkt_size" is the size of the packets we're actually currently
 * sending to our peer.  This value is maintained to be the min of
 * ".max_tsdu", ".max_path_tpdu", and the TPDU info of fack bodies we
 * receive from our peer.
 *
 * ".awaiting_ack" is true in case we're expecting some sort of
 * acknowledgement (e.g., response, fack, ack, working) from the receiver.
 * This field (in conjunction with ".awaiting_ack_timestamp") is used
 * to decide when to declare the receiver dead.
 *
 * The queue is empty when 'head' == NULL.
 *            
 * Several fields within the queue are used for adjusting the blast size.
 * This mechanism is not present for "fine tuning" the blast size; it
 * is for the case where we have a very reliable connection to a fast
 * reciever and facks are returning so quickly that we are not able to
 * grow the congestion grow (i.e. we're not able to start a pipeline
 * of outstanding packets).  ".max_blast_size" is the limit to the number
 * of packets that will be sent back-to-back.  Periodically, if we aren't
 * seeing lost packets and we notice that the congestion window is not
 * reaching the advertised window size, we will increase the blast size
 * by 2.  We may do this twice, reaching a maximum blast of 8.  The field
 * ".high_cwindow" is used to keep track of congestion window growth
 * between these periodic adjustments.  The time between adjustments
 * is controlled by ".xq_timer", a counter which gets decremented each
 * time we receive a fack which does not report a loss.  Initially we
 * check after 8 such facks have arrived.  However, each time the blast
 * size is adjusted, we increment ".xq_timer_throttle" which is used
 * as a multiplier for ".xq_timer".  That is, the periods between
 * considering a change to the blast size become longer and longer, to
 * prevent oscillating around the blast size limit.
 * 
 * The entire xmitq inherits the containing structure's locking
 * requirements and is protected by that structure's lock.

 * To avoid tieing up the thread, we will allow transmissions to be made
 * from the listener/timer thread in cases where the call has transitioned
 * to the final state.  However, if an EWOULDBLOCK error occurs, it will be

 * This solution was deemed acceptable based on the following observations:  
 *
 *      1) All packets have been successfully sent atleast once (w/o EWOULDBLOCK)
 *      2) On a timeout, there could be at most 4 packets left to send.  The

 *         out two packets, both requesting facks.  Hopefully, at least one will
 *         get through.

/*
 * Client connection table (CCT) and connection table elements (CCTE).
 *
 * Keeps track of all "connections" from the local client address space
 * to remote servers.  The CCT is keyed by authentication info.  The
 * CCT is a hash table with separate chaining.
 * 
 * A client wanting to make a call picks a connection to use by looking
 * up a non-inuse CCTE that has a matching authentication information
 * handle.  If it finds an entry, it uses that entry's activity ID (actid)
 * and sequence number in its call.  The client increments the sequence
 * number in the table and sets the "in use" flag for the duration of
 * the client's call.  If the client finds no matching entry, it creates
 * a new entry by generating a new UUID as the activity ID.  Maintain
 * the chains in "oldest first" order.  This will cause older available
 * entries to be reused before newer entries thereby naturally limiting
 * the ccte (actid) selection to a smaller set.
 * 
 * The CCT is garbage collectable -- slots containing entries that are
 * not "in use" can be re-assigned to new auth's.  Any deletions in the
 * CCT *must* increment the CCT's GC counter.
 * 
 * See "dgglob.h" for definition of the table itself.
 * 
 * A CCTE that is not inuse is "owned" by the CCT and inherits its locking
 * requirements.  When a CCTE is inuse (".refcnt" > 1 -- note that the
 * CCT's reference itself counts as a reference), all fields except the
 * next field are "owned" by the call that is using this connection.
 * The next field is always "owned" by the CCT.
 * 
 * The relationship between the CCTEs, activity ids, auth-infos, call
 * handles, and binding handles is important (to make things work at
 * all, as well as work efficiently).  So, here's more info on the topic:
 *
 *      Actids are the cornerstone of all client / server conversations.
 *      Servers identify clients by an actid.
 * 
 *      Actids have an associated non-decreasing RPC Call Sequence Number.
 * 
 *      A single actid may be used by a single RPC at a time.
 * 
 *      Actids have an associated authentication identity which is fixed
 *      for the lifetime of the actid.  If for no other reason, this
 *      mapping of an actid to an auth-info is an artifact of the NCA
 *      DG protocol.  (There is no free space in the DG packet header,
 *      so the actid is "overloaded" to allow the server to determine
 *      the client's auth-info.)
 * 
 *      A single auth-info may be bound to any number of NCS binding
 *      handles (handle_t) subject to the auth package and application
 *      restrictions.  (I.e., the authentication package decides whether
 *      the same auth-info can be used for multiple servers that happen
 *      to have the same principal ID.)
 *
 *      Servers cache state across RPCs based on actid to lessen the
 *      need for the server to callback a client to validate the RPC
 *      sequence number or learn the auth session key.
 * 
 *      For clients to take advantage of server caching, they are
 *      encouraged to reuse actids on subsequent RPCs to a server that
 *      already knows that actid.
 *
 * Subtlety relating to server boot time
 * -------------------------------------
 *
 * Clients who don't (yet) know a server's boot time (i.e., whose binding
 * handle ".server_boot" time is zero) MUST generate a new CCTE/actid
 * before making a call.  Doing so ensures that the server does a WAY
 * callback to the client and that the client acquires the boot time.
 * The problem case we're trying to avoid is as follows:
 * 
 * - Client creates a binding to a server and calls it.
 * - The server calls back to client (WAY) causing the binding to acquire 
 *   the server's boot time.  
 * - The client creates a NEW binding to the same server and calls it
 *   using the same actid as in previous call.
 *
 * Since the server already knows about this actid (and sequence number)
 * it does NOT call back and the new binding doesn't acquire the server's
 * boot time.  This can cause protocol problems (inability to detect
 * a duplicate WAY from a rebooted instance of a server that's already
 * executed our call once).  (See "conv_who_are_you" in "conv.c" for
 * background.)
 * 
 * What's going on here is that on the one hand we're trying to minimize
 * the number of actids we create (in an attempt to minimize the number
 * of WAY callbacks that happen) and we can't (easily) keep track of
 * the boot times of all the servers which we've called with each actid,
 * while on the other hand, we MUST know the server boot time to maintain
 * "at most once" semantics.  You might imagine that a CCTE could hold
 * a list of boot times (keyed by server location) and that when you
 * picked up a CCTE, you'd stick the right boot time from its list into
 * the binding handle, but this would be complicated (if it works at all!).
 * We take the simpler approach of forcing new CCTE/actids to be created
 * for each binding.  This results in an excess of CCTEs, but they can
 * be put to good effect later (e.g., in parallel calls being made using
 * a single binding).
 *
 * Another fallout from this approach is that when a first call on a
 * binding gets a comm failure (i.e., times out), there are cases where
 * we can KNOW that the server didn't execute the call (i.e., in case
 * the call was to a non-idem procedure and the boot time in the binding
 * is zero--i.e., the server didn't call us back).  This turns out to
 * be useful since when a client has multiple bindings to some sort of
 * replicated service, there are (more) cases where it knows that it's
 * safe to move onto another binding (i.e., without accidentally executing
 * the call more than once).  We expect this to be a common occurrence
 * (e.g., in network partitions where some of the bindings you have are
 * to unreachable servers).

 * Call handle common header (CALL).
 *
 * Defines data that is common to client and server call handles
 * (see below).  Note that we're using the transmit queue's prototype
 * packet header as the repository for various per-call state (e.g. seq
 * #, interface ID).
 * 
 * The mutex (".mutex") protects fields in the composite call handles
 * (i.e., CCALLs and SCALLs).  The call handle mutex is a level 2 lock.
 * 
 * The condition variable (".cv") is used to wait for changes in the
 * call handle (typically, changes to the transmit and receive queues)
 * and is partnered with the handle's mutex.
 *        
 * The high_seq field is used to keep track of the sequence number space
 * in the event of callbacks.  This can get updated in two ways.  First,
 * by receiving a response with a bumped-up sequence number, as in the
 * 1.5 code.  Second, by receiving a request packet on the current activity
 * ID.  The second form will help avoid problems with having a callback
 * die (timeout, etc) and not receiving the results from the original
 * call;  in this case, we will still begin a new call with the appropriate
 * sequence number.
 *
 * The reference count (".refcnt") keeps track of all references to the
 * call handle.  For client call handles, references can be from:
 *
 *      - Client binding handles (cached client call handles).
 *      - The CCALLT.
 *      - The application thread (via the return from "start call").
 *      - The call handle's timer.
 *
 * Almost all fields are protected by the call handle's lock.  Two
 * exceptions: (1) the ".next" field, which is essentially owned and
 * protected by the data structure upon which the call handle is chained
 * (i.e. the binding handle); (2) the ".is_in_pkt_chain" flag, which
 * is owned and protected by the packet pool logic (and is therefore
 * wrapped with "unsigned : 0"s to (hopefully) force alignment).
 *
 * All call handle lock, condition wait and signalling operations should
 * be done via the macros below.

 * Client call handle (CCALL).
 *
 * Defines the dg-specific, client-specific structure referred to 
 * from an rpc_call_rep_t.
 *
 * CCALLs are entered into the CCALL table (CCALLT); see below.
 *
 * A call handle is associated with both a single binding handle and
 * a single CCTE.  In addition to providing the data structures for a
 * in-progress call, a call handle provides a inter-RPC cache of useful
 * information to allow us to quickly start up subsequent RPCs.  Changes
 * to the state of the binding handle (e.g. object id, server location)
 * require that the call handle be appropriatly updated.  On every call,
 * the call handle's per call state (e.g. interface id, ihint, opn) must
 * be properly initialized.
 * 
 * An in-progress call increments its associated CCTE's reference count
 * for the duration of the call (thereby reserving the CCTE's actid).
 * The reference count should not be decremented until the call no longer
 * requires the exclusive use of that actid.
 * 
 * A call handle may be re-associated with a new CCTE (if the last one
 * it used happens to be "inuse" or has been freed and a call is starting
 * up).  If such a re-association occurs, cached activity related info in
 * the call handle (e.g., the actid and the ahint) need to be reinitialized.
 *
 * Callbacks 
 * ---------
 *
 * The server call handle (".cbk_scall") refers to the handle of a callback
 * from the remote server to the local client.  Callbacks are indicated
 * by the receipt of request packet on a socket being used by a client;
 * the activity ID in the request must match the activity ID being used
 * by the client making the call.  (Requests packets with non-matching
 * activity IDs received on client sockets are discarded.)
 * 
 * When a callback request is received, the request packet handling code
 * sets ".cbk_start" and awakens the application client thread to let
 * it know to start executing the callback.
 * 
 * Callback SCALLs linger around for a while (cached on the paired ccall)
 * in the case of a non-idempotent callback that is awaiting a response
 * ack.  The callback SCALL is freed when the original call completes.
 * 
 * The following shows the relationships among the CCALLT, CCALLs, and
 * SCALLs in the case of callback processing in the original client
 * processing (i.e. where the callback manager is executing).  Note the
 * values of the {s,c}call fields in this picture and how the differ
 * from the previous picture; this is critical to understanding callback
 * relationships.
 *
 * This is only the original client process half of a callback.  Refer
 * to the above description of SCALLs for the special relationships that
 * exist for a CCALL that is created to perform a callback.

 * Note the special case of the "conv_who_are_you" (WAY) callback used
 * to do "connection management".  For protocol correctness reasons,
 * the request packet in this callback does not have the same activity
 * ID as the client.  We handle this case specially (no cbk scall is used); 
 * see comments above "rpc__dg_handle_conv" for details.
 * 
 *
 * Proxy Calls
 * -----------
 *
 * Proxy calls are calls from a server manager during the execution of
 * an "originating" call that are performed using the client's activity
 * id (hence sequence number space).  Callbacks as described above are
 * one form of proxy calls.  The sequence number from the server's response
 * packet header tells us the highest sequence number it consumed doing
 * proxy calls is saved (".high_seq").  This enables us to properly
 * manage this activities sequence number space in the face of such calls.
 * When the original call completes, the value of the response sequence
 * number is stored back into the CCTE.
 * 
 * All fields are protected by the common call handle lock.
 *
 * LOCKING HIERARCHY:
 *  The only occasion where more than one call handle may require locking
 *  at any instant is due to callbacks.  The locking hierarchy for callback
 *  ccall / scall pairs depends on which side of the wire you're on (which
 *  really means which call of the pair has been tagged ".is_cbk == true").
 *  The reason for the difference is for convienience to the listener
 *  processing.  In the original client process, the listener will have
 *  a ccall and need to get the associated is_cbk scall.  In the original
 *  server process the listener will have a scall and will need to get
 *  the associated is_cbk ccall.  See the above for a visual description.
 *  
 *  So, the locking hierarchy order is (first, second):
 *      ccall, is_cbk scall
 *      scall, is_cbk ccall

/*
 * Server connection table (SCT)
 *
 * A mapping from remote client activity IDs (the keys) to server calls.
 * The SCT is a hash table with separate chaining.  The SCT is used by
 * the packet listen loop to dispatch incoming packets received on server
 * connection sockets to the appropriate server call handle.  Additionally
 * the SCT holds "inter-call history" about remote clients (seq and
 * auth_info).
 * 
 * The SCT is roughly the server-side analog to the CCALLT and CCT.  It's
 * like the CCALLT in that it's the database for demultiplexing packets
 * to call handles based on the packet's activity ID.  It's like the
 * CCT in that it maintains inter-call history.  We maintain this
 * information as a single table on the server side so that we can deal
 * with the case of request from previously unknown clients without having
 * to do lookups/inserts into two tables.  (The client being the initiator
 * of calls doesn't have the problem of dealing with packets arriving
 * from unknown servers.)
 *
 * The ".ahint" field in the packet header of packets sent from client
 * to server (i.e. NOT callback) is an index into the SCT.
 *
 * Logically, a "server" maintains some RPC sequence number information
 * for a connection to model the client's sequence number state; this
 * is done to allow the server to detect/prevent reruns of non-idempotent
 * RPCs.  The server is only truely synchronized with the client when
 * it performs a WAY to definitively learn the client's current sequence
 * number.  In all other instances the model is only approximate due
 * to the fact that the server doesn't necessarily see all RPCs the client
 * makes (nor is the client obgligated to only increase the seq by 1
 * on each succesive call).
 *
 * At any instant, the SCTE ".high_seq" represents the *highest* RPC
 * seq of the following: "tentatively accepted" RPCs for execution by
 * the server, RPCs actually executed by the server or the result of
 * a WAY.  The creation of a SCTE occurs because a request pkt for a
 * connection is received and the server knows nothing about the
 * connection.  A created SCTE's ".high_seq" is initialized to the
 * (inducing_request_seq - 1); logically the highest previous call that
 * the server could have known about.
 *
 * A call may be tentatively accepted as long as it's sequence number
 * is greater than the SCTE ".high_seq"; this new sequence becomes
 * the SCTE ".high_seq".  The state of the SCTE ".high_seq" is represented
 * by ".high_seq_is_way_validated".  Initially ".high_seq_is_way_validated"
 * is false; it is set to true once a WAY is performed to the client.
 * A WAY validated SCTE ".high_seq" must be used for comparison prior
 * the actual execution (stub dispatch) of a tentatively accepted
 * Non-idempotent RPC.
 *
 * Note that in the case of maybe-calls, it is not necessary for the 
 * call's sequence number to be greater that the SCTE ".high_seq", since
 * the call's request packet could have been (legally) reordered wrt a
 * packet from a subsequent call; in this case the maybe call will not
 * update the ".high_seq" field.
 *
 * The SCTE ".scall" field points to a SCALL for the connection.  This
 * field is used both to locate the SCALL for an in-progress call and
 * as a place to cache a previously created / used SCALL.  If the SCALL
 * ".call_seq" field matches the SCTE ".high_seq" field then the SCALL
 * is for the connection's current (or just completed) call; otherwise
 * the SCALL is just being cached and logically does not contain useful
 * information.
 *
 * The SCTE ".maybe_chain" field points to a list of scalls which represent
 * currently/recently executing calls made using the "maybe" attribute.
 * Since the client does not wait for such calls to complete before
 * continuing, it's perfectly legal to have several of maybe calls executing
 * in paralel.
 *
 * See the dgsct.[ch] for the operations available for the SCT.
 * 
 * Each SCTE is reference counted.  The SCALLs reference to the SCTE
 * counts as a reference.  Lookup and get functions increment the ref
 * count since they are returning a reference.  The SCT reference to the
 * SCTE DOES count as a reference.
 *
 * The SCT is garbage collectable -- SCTEs that are not "inuse" (i.e.
 * refcnt == 1; only referenced by the SCT) can be freed.
 * 
 * See "dgglob.h" for definition of the table itself.
 *
 * The SCT and all it's elements are protected by the global lock.
