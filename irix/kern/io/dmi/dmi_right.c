   PLEASE NOTE: It is possible for this routine to generate DM_EVENT_DESTROY
   events, because its calls to dm_put_tdp drop vnode references, and another
   thread may have already unlinked a file whose vnode we are de-referencing.
   This sets the stage for various types of deadlock if the thread calling
   dm_put_tevp is the same thread that calls dm_respond_event!  In particular,
   the dm_sent_destroy_event routine needs to obtain the dm_reg_lock,
   dm_session_lock, and sn_qlock in order to queue the destroy event.  No
   caller of dm_put_tevp can hold any of these locks!

   Other possible deadlocks are that dm_send_destroy_event could block waiting
   for a thread to register for the event using  dm_set_disp() and/or
   dm_set_return_on_destroy, or it could block because the session's sn_newq
   is at the dm_max_queued_msgs event limit.  The only safe solution
   (unimplemented) is to have a separate kernel thread for each filesystem
   whose only job is to do the vnode-dereferencing.  That way dm_respond_event
   will not block, so the application can keep calling dm_get_events to read
   events even if the filesystem thread should block.  (If the filesystem
   thread blocks, so will all subsequent destroy events for the same
   filesystem.)
