# Global compile options

# Also see SYSCONFIGDEFS below for more debug options that may be selected at
# sysgen time.  If the KDEBUG is set to a non-empty string, many debug
# options are automatically selected.  See kcommondefs for the current list.
#
#    -DDEBUG		- Turn on general DEBUG ASSERTION()'s, etc.  Nothing
#			  under DEBUG should impact performance more than
#			  ~10%.  More ambitious sanity checking should be
#			  put under separate DEBUG_{FOO} defines.
#    -DDEBUG_ALLOC	- Turn on ``kmem poisoning.''  This causes free()'s
#			  of dynamic memory to result in the memory being
#			  ``poisoned'' with values likely to cause panics
#			  and/or ASSERT()'s if referenced.  Currently this
#			  poisoning is the return address of the caller with
#			  a 1 or'ed into the bottom bit (to cause faults if
#			  used as a pointer).  This option is pretty cheap
#			  and well worth using.  Note that kmem poisoning is
#			  also automatically enabled if DEBUG is defined.
#    -DEBUG_BUFTRACE	- Turn on very extensive buffer cache sanity checking
#			  code.
#    -DSEMAINFOP	- Add fast info pointer to all sleeping kernel
#			  synchronization objects (see comments in
#			  sys/sema_private.h)
