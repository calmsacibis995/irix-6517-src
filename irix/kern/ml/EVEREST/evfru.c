This file is obsolete since the FRU analyzer is now outside the kernel,
but the code here is still useful if you need to understand the Everest
error handling hardware.  The last real version was 1.16.  Please check it
out if you want to see the code or refer to irix/cmd/icrash/fru for the
code in the current FRU analzyer.
