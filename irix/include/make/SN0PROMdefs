# IP27 multi-processor product definitions.
#
# This is the PRODUCT to compile the IO6prom for SN0.
# It should closely resemble the SN0defs file, except it is
# used to build the full version of the IO6 Prom. The IO6 prom
# is needed on the IO6 as well as a smaller version which is needed 
# as a part of the IP27 prom for use on SN00 and as a backup to the
# IO6 prom.
#
# This file is used for building the actual prom to be
# flashed on the IO6 board. The server proms for SN00 and built into
# the IP27prom for SN0 must be built under the product name SN0
#
# Fundamental constants of the build tree (distinct from source tree).
# They may be different for each product.  Therefore if several products are
# built from one source tree, that source tree should contain a commondefs
# for each product.
#
# Since this file is supposed to be almost identical to SN0defs,
# we simply include SN0defs here, and override any values here.
# Unfortunately, we need to include most of the basic definitions here
# because some @#$^*! scripts in the OpenGL build expect them to be.
#
# Anyway, the main point is that we automatically pick up the
# (currently) frequently changing definitions (e.g. KMODEOPT).
