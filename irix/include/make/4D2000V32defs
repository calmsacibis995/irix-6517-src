# IP21 multi-processor product definitions.
#
# This file is temporarily called BB_EVERESTdefs before a more appropriate
# product name is chosen.
# Two kinds of cpu boards , IP19 and IP21, may be used in EVEREST system.
# BB_EVERESTdefs defines an EVEREST system using IP21 CPU board.
# GFXBOARD and SUBGR are TBD.
#
# Fundamental constants of the build tree (distinct from source tree).
# They may be different for each product.  Therefore if several products are
# built from one source tree, that source tree should contain a commondefs
# for each product.
