#
# IP27 multi-processor product definitions.
#
# This is the PRODUCT to compile gfx for SN0 with KONA (aka HILO) graphics.
# It should closely resemble the SN0defs file, except for any differences
# specific to the different gfx architectures.
#
# Fundamental constants of the build tree (distinct from source tree).
# They may be different for each product.  Therefore if several products are
# built from one source tree, that source tree should contain a commondefs
# for each product.
#
# Since this file is supposed to be almost identical to SN0defs,
# we simply include SN0defs here, and override any values here.
# Unfortunately, we need to include most of the basic definitions here
# because some @#$^*! scripts in the OpenGL build expect them to be.
#
# Anyway, the main point is that we automatically pick up the
# (currently) frequently changing definitions (e.g. KMODEOPT).
