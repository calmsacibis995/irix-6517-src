# IP19 multi-processor product definitions.

# This is a PRODUCT to compile a 64 bit EVEREST kernel with
# the Ragnarok compiler suite.
#
# Fundamental constants of the build tree (distinct from source tree).
# They may be different for each product.  Therefore if several products are
# built from one source tree, that source tree should contain a commondefs
# for each product.
