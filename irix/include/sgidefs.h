 * Compilation Environments
 *	The compiler can offer a set of different compilation environments.
 *	Each one will pre-define the above defines appropriately.
 * 	If you use the _MIPS_* defines, you should include this header file.
 * 	In order to avoid problems when sgidefs.h is not included, the driver
 * 	predefines _MIPS_ISA and _MIPS_SIM to be the actual values (1-4) 
 *	rather than the _MIPS_* names (otherwise, if sgidefs.h is not 
 *	included, we would be defining _MIPS_SIM to be an undefined value).
 * 
 * The following #if conditions will be true in each environment:
 * 	The MIPS ABI (-o32) environment:
 * 	_MIPS_ISA == _MIPS_ISA_MIPS1 or _MIPS_ISA_MIPS2
 *	_MIPS_SIM == _MIPS_SIM_ABI32
 *	_MIPS_FPSET == 16
 *	_MIPS_SZINT == 32
 *	_MIPS_SZLONG == 32
 *	_MIPS_SZPTR == 32
 *
 * 	The new MIPS 32-bit ABI (-n32) environment:
 * 	_MIPS_ISA == _MIPS_ISA_MIPS3 or _MIPS_ISA_MIPS4
 *	_MIPS_SIM == _MIPS_SIM_NABI32
 *	_MIPS_FPSET == 32
 *	_MIPS_SZINT == 32
 *	_MIPS_SZLONG == 32
 *	_MIPS_SZPTR == 32
 *
 * 	The MIPS 64-bit ABI (-64) environment:
 * 	_MIPS_ISA == _MIPS_ISA_MIPS3 or _MIPS_ISA_MIPS4
 *	_MIPS_SIM == _MIPS_SIM_ABI64
 *	_MIPS_FPSET == 32
 *	_MIPS_SZINT == 32
 *	_MIPS_SZLONG == 64
 *	_MIPS_SZPTR == 64

 * Language Specific
 * Type __psint_t - a pointer sized int - this can be used:
 *	a) when casting a pointer so can perform e.g. a bit operation
 *	b) as a return code for functions incorrectly typed as int but

 * User level code can also use the ANSI std ptrdiff_t, defined in stddef.h
 *	in place of __psint_t
 * Type __scint_t - a 'scaling' int - used when in fact one wants an 'int'

/*
 *	64-bit integer types
 *
 *  (1)	In Irix6.1, the compiler implements a new internal type
 *	called  __long_long.   It's purpose is to allow SGI to
 *	define  __int64_t  and __uint64_t  without using
 *	long long or structs or unions.  
 *
 *	The reason for this is that several types in Irix are
 *	being (or will be) promoted to 64-bit integers and will
 *	be typedef'd as either __int64_t  or __uint64_t.  If
 *	these types are defined using  long long, then ANSI 
 *	requires the C compiler to complain because long long
 *	is not standard conforming.  If these types are defined
 *	using a struct or a union, then the programmer can not
 *	use them in arithmetic statements.  The solution we
 *	adopted was to create a new internal type,  __long_long,
 *	that is a synonym for  long long, but whose use does
 *	not violate ANSI rules.
 *
 *	NOTE:	__long_long should not be used anyplace other than
 *		in this header file.  All other 64-bit integer
 *		types should be defined in terms of __int64_t 
 *		or __uint64_t.
 *
 *	
 *  (2)	The reason for the messy set of defines that follow is
 *	that some compilers (old CFRONT, and cc68k) do not
 *	use __long_long.  Therefore, we allow each to choose
 *	which of the following three definitions of 64-bit ints
 *	they want to use:
 *		1.	long long
 *		2.	__long_long
 *		3.	struct { ... }
