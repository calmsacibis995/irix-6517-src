At this point it has been determined that failing R10K FPU's cannot be
found by simply running "tomcatv" on the CPU and diffing a file. 
Currently, Mohan Natarajan has a plan for testing the crippled CPU
and these tests will be incorporated into this test-harness once they
are completed (10/97 timeframe).

				

The below is a note added by Elkova Icenogle (elkova@cs.stanford.edu):

This file was put here because there is unfinished business in this
directory.  The things that are checked in but are not on any install
line or anything like that are:

	tomcatv/ (and everything in it)
	onlinediag_all.config

I didn't know where to install these or really to where to check them
in, so they are here for now so they don't get lost.

Once tomcatv finds a permanent home, the following files must be updated
to reflect this home:

	onlinediag.config -- needs to find tomcatv in the correct place.
	tomcatv/runtest -- this needs to know where tomcatv the
		executable can be found

diags/server/stress/paranoia/d_paranoia must be installed in a place
where onlinediag.config can list it as being stored and then
onlinediag.config must change to reflect this place as well.
