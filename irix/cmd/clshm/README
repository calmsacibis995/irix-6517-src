WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE CLSHM STUFF IS REALLY USABLE/EXPORTED!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please read the web pages --> ./doc/web/index.html for links

Here is the basics off the status web page:

The general functionality is finished. Mostly testing is left to be done
as well as checking in the files and doing the idb stuff. Things to be
done to make this fully functional:

* irix/lib/libclshm:
	Edit irix/lib/Makefile to make libclshm

	Place irix/lib/libclshm/src/xp_shm.h in the appropriate place


* irix/cmd/clshm/clshm_diag:
	Build and install irix/lib/libclshm since clshm_diag depends on it.

	#define CLSHM_USR_LIB_LINKED at beginning of clshm_diag.c.

	Edit irix/cmd/clshm/Makefile to include lines for making
		clshm_diag with the library flags.

	Change the include line of "irix/lib/libclshm/src/xp_shm.h" in
		clshm_diag.c to point to wherever it was decided that
		xp_shm.h will live.


* irix/cmd/clshm/test:
	Edit xp_shm_wrap.h to include the place of the correct xp_shm.h


* irix/cmd/clshm/doc/man:
	Move part_func.3p and xp_func.3p into irix/man/man3p.


* irix/kern/master.d/system.gen
	Edit to add "EXCLUDE: clshm" right after the "EXCLUDE: if_cl"
		(this is general -- to actually enable -- will have to
		change all "EXCLUDE"s to "USE" for all partitioning
		stuff).


* idb stuff:
	Edit irix/cmd/clshm/Makefile idb stuff -- There is something
		there commented out that I think will work, but you
		should probably make sure before just adding it
		blindly. Need to add the clshmd.config file.

	Edit irix/build/idb: need to add a lot -- some of these are
		already there, but will be needed for "target"
		information. Here are all the things I can think of:
		+ etc/config/clshm.config
		+ etc/init.d/sn0start
		+ usr/cpu/sysgen/IP27boot/clshm.o
		+ usr/etc/clshm_diag
		+ usr/etc/clshmctl
		+ usr/etc/clshmd
		+ usr/include/sys/SN/clshm.h
		+ usr/include/sys/SN/clshmd.h
		+ usr/include/sys/xp_shm.h
		+ usr/lib32/libclshm.so
		+ usr/lib32/mips4/libclshm.so
		+ usr/lib32/mips3/libclshm.so
		+ usr/lib64/libclshm.so
		+ usr/lib64/mips4/libclshm.so
		+ usr/lib64/mips3/libclshm.so
		+ usr/share/catman/a_man/man1/clshm_diag.z
		+ usr/share/catman/a_man/man1/clshmctl.z
		+ usr/share/catman/a_man/man1/clshmd.z
		+ usr/share/catman/p_man/man3p/part_func.z
		+ usr/share/catman/p_man/cat3p/part_getcount.z
		+ usr/share/catman/p_man/cat3p/part_gethostname.z
		+ usr/share/catman/p_man/cat3p/part_getid.z
		+ usr/share/catman/p_man/cat3p/part_getlist.z
		+ usr/share/catman/p_man/cat3p/part_getnode.z
		+ usr/share/catman/p_man/cat3p/part_getpart.z
		+ usr/share/catman/p_man/cat3p/part_setpmo.z
		+ usr/share/catman/p_man/cat3p/xp_ftok.z
		+ usr/share/catman/p_man/cat3p/xp_func.z
		+ usr/share/catman/p_man/cat3p/xp_shmat.z
		+ usr/share/catman/p_man/cat3p/xp_shmctl.z
		+ usr/share/catman/p_man/cat3p/xp_shmdt.z
		+ usr/share/catman/p_man/cat3p/xp_shmget.z

	There are probably more things, but I guess that will have to be
		fixed up later.
