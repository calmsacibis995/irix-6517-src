Internal Structure</H1>
<H2>
Original Design</H2>
<P>
The clshm driver and daemon were originally written by Kaushik Ghosh. 
It had an ioctl user interface with mmaps. The user would call into the 
driver with a request and then send it ioctl queries until the driver 
indicated that the request had been satisfied. The driver would send 
any request for other partitions to the daemon through shared memory 
which simply passed the information on to the daemon of the other 
partition. The daemon would talk to the driver through ioctl calls as 
well. There was a mechanism of &quot;jobs&quot;, where every job was 
basically a hwgraph file that could be mmap to create a different share 
memory segment. So all processes that wanted to talk would decide ahead 
of time which job (00 through 0f) to use. All state was saved in the 
driver and the daemon was used only for sending messages to the other 
drivers. </P>
<H2>
Interface Changes</H2>
<P>
The original idea was to place a user interface on top of the already 
existing clshm interface. However, we wanted to place a system V shared 
memory type interface on top and this did not work with this the 
existing ioctl interface. So instead of fighting with what was already 
there, most of the code was changed. The original error handling and 
calls into the xpc and partition code were used, but almost everthing 
else changed.</P>
<P>
The interface was changed to look like the system V shared memory 
interface and all the complexity of calling into the driver was 
replaced by a user library that talked to the daemon. The original 
&quot;jobs&quot; idea was removed and replaced by a single hwgraph file 
that would be mmapped by all different processes that want shared 
memory segments. The different shared memory segments use different 
offsets into this file.</P>
<H2>
User Library</H2>
<P>
The user library caches some state of what is going on, but mostly 
talks to the daemon with sockets to get state about existing shared 
memory segments and to set up new shared memory segments. The following <A
 HREF="man.html#xp_func">xp_*</A>
 functions were defined and have similar meanings as their system V 
counterparts:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
    xp_ftok: create a key useable by clshm. The partition that the memory 
    will reside is determined at the time this is called. It is either 
    specified by a path into the hwgraph (/hw/clshm/partition/XX) or by 
    placing the memory on the calling process's partition. 
    <LI>
    xp_shmget: associates a key with a shmid with a given size. 
    <LI>
    xp_shmat: attaches the given shmid. 
    <LI>
    xp_shmdt: detaches the given shmid. 
    <LI>
    xp_shmctl: takes IPC_RMID (to remove a shmid associated segment) and 
    IPC_AUTORMID (to specify that the segment should be removed 
    automatically after the last detach). 
</UL>
<P>
In addition to the system V like shared memory calls, there are also <A
 HREF="man.html#part_func">part_*</A>
 helper functions that are also provided to get information about 
partitioning in general.</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
    part_getid: get the partition id of the partition we are running on. 
    <LI>
    part_getcount: get the number of partitions that are up. 
    <LI>
    part_getlist: get the list of partition numbers that are up. 
    <LI>
    part_gethostnames: get the hostnames of the partitions that are up. 
    <LI>
    part_getpart: get the partition that owns a shmid. 
    <LI>
    part_setpmo: set a pmo_handle/type to be assigned to a key before 
    the shmid is created. This uses the mld interface to place the memory 
    associated with this key on a specific node.
    <LI>
    part_getnode: get the node path in the hwgraph of the memory associated 
    with the shmid (but only if the memory was all placed on a single node).
</UL>
<P>
The user library talks to the daemon sending messages that are 
specified in the daemon header file (clshmd.h) through a socket. All 
messages wait for a return message from the daemon before they return 
from the call into the user library. There are also locks within the 
user library so that it is protected if there are multi threads using 
the same socket to talk to the daemon.</P>
<H2>
Clshm Daemon</H2>
<P>
The <A HREF="man.html#clshmd">clshmd</A>
 daemon sits in the middle of the driver and the user library and does 
all communication between the two. It also talks to other daemons on 
other partitions. It keeps the state of all keys and manages all 
shmids. The daemon was changed from the original code so that the user 
library does not make any ioctl calls into the driver and also to pull 
as much code out of the kernel as possible and into a user level (more 
easily debuggable) program. The daemon is started and stopped by the 
command.</P>
<H2>
Clshm Driver</H2>
<P>
The driver does the actual calls to the xpc and partition layer. It 
gets messages from the local partition's daemon about what pages to 
register as cross partition pages and when to allocate the pages. It 
also gets mmap calls directly from the user library that actually 
attach to the cross partition pages. Error recovery code is included to 
kill off any process that is trying to access cross partition pages 
which the permissions have been taken away or if another partition 
dies, etc. The daemon is sent messages though shared memory any time 
state changes as well (other partitions die, someone attaches to a 
page, etc).</P>
<H2>
Version Control</H2>
<P>
All pieces of the system have their own major and minor version 
numbers. The driver, the daemon and the user library all have separate 
version numbers. The major version numbers must always match. If they 
don't, then the code will fail as soon as they try to talk to any other 
piece of the system. The minor version numbers don't need to match, but 
the piece of the system with the larger minor version number is 
responsible for making sure that the two different version interoperate 
correcly.</P>
