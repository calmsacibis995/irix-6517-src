Configurations</H2>
<P>
All the testing done so far has been done on simple two partition 
systems. The two systems that clshm has been tried on are a two module 
system with one node on each module and a 256 processor system broken 
into two fully populated 128p partitions. Testing should also be done 
on a system with more than two partitions. The more paritions the 
better to stress the possible race conditions that exist in the daemon. 
To set up the machines to run the clshm driver, see the <A
 HREF="setup.html">Setting Up a System</A>
 section.</P>

Current Tests Available</H2>
<P>
The following stress tests have been created:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
    shmtest 
    <LI>
    shmsmall 
    <LI>
    shmzero 
    <LI>
    shmlen 
    <LI>
    shmauto 
</UL>
<P>
Shmtest is the largest and most generic test. It has a lot of command 
line options to test the various features of the shared memory library. 
It opens up a shared memory segment for each partition and creates 
multiple threads to read and write to all the different partitions' 
segments at the same time. The command must be called with the same 
command line options on all partitions that exist in order for it to 
run successfully. It uses a simple barrier implementation using shared 
memory found in a helper module (clshm_barrier.c/.h) to synchronise the 
reading and writing passes of testing. Pass &quot;-h&quot; to shmtest 
to print out the diffferent command line options available.</P>
<P>
The other tests are more specific. Shmsmall just calls all the 
different <A HREF="man.html#xp_func">xp_*</A>
 functions on the same partition and makes sure that they all return 
appropriate values. Shmzero makes sure that shared memory pages are 
given to us in a zeroed out form. Shmlen attempts to xp_shmget the same 
shmid with different lengths (which should fail). Shmauto tests the 
auto cleanup feature that was added to automatically clean up a shared 
memory segment after the last detach. It sends an auto cleanup message 
at different stages in the the xp_shmget/xp_shmat/xp_shmdt sequence.</P>
<H2>
Needed Tests</H2>
<P>
The following tests are needed to complete the tests</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
    Bogus parameters to library interface calls. 
    <LI>
    Stress sending all types of messages (calling all xp_*calls) at 
    same time (both from multiple partitions and multiple processes on a 
    single partition). 
    <LI>
    Test shutting down partitions while shared memory programs are running. 
    <LI>
    Test shutting down partitions while xp_* calls are asking for info from 
    another partition.
