Setting Up a System</H1>
<H2>
Hardware and Software Requirements</H2>
<P>
The system must meet the requirements for running as a <A
 HREF="http://babylon.engr.sgi.com/sn/doc/index.html">partitioned system</A>. 
This includes having an Origin 2000 with at least 2.3 hubs and having 
that system partitioned into one of the <A
 HREF="http://babylon.engr.sgi.com/sn/doc/part.html#cfg">supported 
configurations</A>. The system has to be running at least version 6.5.3 
of Irix and have all the necessary clshm files installed and modules 
configured into the operating system.</P>
<H2>
Configuring the Operating System</H2>
<P>
/var/sysgen/system/irix.sm must have the following modules changed from 
being EXCLUDE to INCLUDE on all partitions in the system:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
    partition 
    <LI>
    xpc 
    <LI>
    cl 
    <LI>
    clshm 
    <LI>
    if_cl (optional) 
</UL>
<P>
And once this is changed all systems should be 
&quot;autoconfig&quot;ed. </P>
<P>
To partition down the system see the mkpart command man pages on the 
system.</P>
<H2>
Necessary Files</H2>
<P>
The following files need to have been installed on your system:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
    <A HREF="man.html#clshmctl">/usr/etc/clshmctl</A> 
    <LI>
    <A HREF="man.html#clshmd">/usr/etc/clshmd</A> 
    <LI>
    <A HREF="man.html#clshm_diag">/usr/etc/clshm_diag</A> 
    <LI>
    /etc/config/clshmd 
    <LI>
    /etc/init.d/sn0start 
    <LI>
    <A HREF="man.html#xp_func">/usr/include/xp_shm.h</A> 
    <LI>
    /usr/lib32/libclshm.so 
    <LI>
    /usr/lib64/libclshm.so 
</UL>
<H2>
Starting Up the Daemon</H2>
<P>
Once the system is up and running as a partitioned system, the clshm 
daemon must be turned on. This is done using the <A
 HREF="man.html#clshmctl">/usr/etc/clshmctl</A> command. Or if you want 
the daemon to be started up every time the system boots up then do a 
&quot;chkconfig clshmd on&quot; and the next time the system boots up 
the daemon will be on. To make sure that all partitions are up and have 
their daemons running run the <A HREF="man.html#clshm_diag">clshm_diag</A>
 command.</P>
