Current Status</H1>
<H2>
Implemented</H2>
<P>
The general functionality is finished. Mostly testing is left to be 
done as well as checking in the files and doing the idb stuff. Things 
to be done to make this fully functional:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
    irix/lib/libclshm: 
    <UL>
        <LI>
        Edit irix/lib/Makefile to make libclshm 
        <LI>
        Place irix/lib/libclshm/src/xp_shm.h in the appropriate place 
    </UL>
    <LI>
    irix/cmd/clshm/clshm_diag: 
    <UL>
        <LI>
        Build and install irix/lib/libclshm since clshm_diag depends on it. 
        <LI>
        #define CLSHM_USR_LIB_LINKED at beginning of clshm_diag.c. 
        <LI>
        Edit irix/cmd/clshm/Makefile to include lines for making clshm_diag 
        with the library flags. 
        <LI>
        Change the include line of &quot;irix/lib/libclshm/src/xp_shm.h&quot; 
        in clshm_diag.c to point to wherever it was decided that xp_shm.h will 
        live. 
    </UL>
    <LI>
    irix/cmd/clshm/test: 
    <UL>
        <LI>
        Edit xp_shm_wrap.h to include the place of the correct xp_shm.h 
    </UL>
    <LI>
    irix/cmd/clshm/doc/man: 
    <UL>
        <LI>
        Move part_func.3p and xp_func.3p into irix/man/man3p. 
    </UL>
    <LI>
    irix/kern/master.d/system.gen:
    <UL>
        <LI>
        Edit to add &quot;EXCLUDE: clshm&quot; right after the &quot;EXCLUDE: 
        if_cl&quot; (this is general -- to actually enable -- will have 
        to change all &quot;EXCLUDE&quot;s to &quot;USE&quot; for all 
        partitioning stuff).
    </UL>
    <LI>
    idb stuff: 
    <UL>
        <LI>
        Edit irix/cmd/clshm/Makefile idb stuff -- There is something there 
        commented out that I think will work, but you should probably make sure 
        before just adding it blindly. Need to add the clshmd.config file. 
        <LI>
        Edit irix/build/idb: need to add a lot -- some of these are already 
        there, but will be needed for &quot;target&quot; information. Here are 
        all the things I can think of:

        There are probably more things, but I guess that will have to be fixed 
        up later.

<H2>
To Be Implemented</H2>
<P>
Permissions on segments???? </P>
<H2>
Issues to Check Into</H2>
<UL>
    <LI>
    Check all kmem_zallocs and kmem_frees to make sure memory isn't being 
    orphaned. 
    <LI>
    Check for sleeping memory allocations while I am holding locks in the 
    clshm and xpc layer. 
    <LI>
    Check for other sleeping calls while I am holding locks. 
</UL>
<H2>
Things That Would Be Nice</H2>
<P>
A lot of these issues are just wish-listed because the fact that the 
setting up of a shared memory segment probably doesn't need to be that 
fast and the daemon will probably not be left running indefinitely. 
Speed is not as much of an issue because once the segments are set up, 
there is no intervention by the driver or daemon unless there is an 
error. So optimizing the setting up or tearing down of the segment is 
not as important. Because of the (perhaps) limited use of this 
interface, these issues may or may not ever become important.</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
    Have a way to clean up keys when something goes wrong between a xp_ftok 
    and an xp_shmget. At this point a key can only be destroyed once a 
    shmget has returned the shmid in order to destroy that key. 
    <LI>
    Add the ability to reuse keys without doing a xp_ftok after the segment 
    has been destroyed. 
    <LI>
    Introduce finer grain locks into the clshm driver. At this point it has 
    only one big lock that protects everything. 
    <LI>
    Make the daemon multi-threaded so that it is faster. 
    <LI>
    Make the user library sockets to the daemon connectionless. Right now 
    they are connection oriented sockets.
