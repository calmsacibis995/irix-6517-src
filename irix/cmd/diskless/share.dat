# Information for diskless client setup

#
#       SERVER ENVIRONMENT SETUP	
#
#	HOSTNAME  : Do not change unless you understand network topologies.
#		    This variable should contain the name of the interface
#		    which is connected directly to the client machines.
#		    For example, a server machine "foobar" has two interfaces.
#		    Its primary interface is FDDI, and its secondary interface
#		    is ethernet.  The client machines are on an ethernet
#		    subnet connected to foobar's ethernet interface.  foobar's
#		    ethernet interface is named "ether-foobar".  In this
#		    case, the HOSTNAME variable below needs to be set to
#		    "ether-foobar".
# 	SHAREHOST : Do not change.
#       SERVER_NIS: yes - server is running NIS.  Implies NIS name lookup 
#			during installation.  Please note that after
#			yp_boot_param runs, it takes time for the information
#			to propogate back to the diskless server from the
#			NIS master.  Also, this option is only fully functional
#			for SGI NIS masters.
#                   no -- server is using local naming service.
#
HOSTNAME="`hostname`"
SHAREHOST="$HOSTNAME"
SERVER_NIS="no"
#
#       SHARE TREE SETUP
#
#       DISKLESS  : directory where all the share trees reside.
#       SHARE     : Do not change.
#
DISKLESS="/diskless" 
SHARE="$DISKLESS/share/$RELEASE"
#
#	DISKLESS CLIENT ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICATIONS
#
# The following variables are set using the table provided in client.dat.
# Please consult that file for valid values.
#
# It is no longer possible to install a share tree with all possible
#	architectures.  The MODE variable must be set to either 
#	(32bit or 64bit).  This is due to 32bit kernels or 64bit
#	kernels running on the client.  So only 32bit kernels
#	can exist together in a share tree and same goes for 64bit
#	kernels.
#
#	If only a subset is to be installed, all 5 must be set.  
#	The example below is for an R4000 Indigo with LIGHT graphics.
#	The MACH variable is now obsolete.
#
#CPUBOARD="IP20"
#CPUARCH="R4000"
#GFXBOARD="LIGHT -mSUBGR=LG1MC"
#VIDEO=""
#MODE="32bit"
#
# To install multiple architectures, set the 5 variables as show below.
# Notice that the initial symbols CPUBOARD, CPUARCH, and GFXBOARD are
# imbedded in the values for the respective variables.  The example below
# contains an R5k O2 with CRIME graphics and an R4k Indy with
# NEWPORT/NG1 graphics.  The MACH variable is now obsolete.
#
#CPUBOARD="IP32 -mCPUBOARD=IP22"
#CPUARCH="R5000 -mCPUARCH=R4000"
#GFXBOARD="CRIME -mSUBGR=CRM -mGFXBOARD=NEWPORT -mSUBGR=NG1"
#VIDEO=""
#MODE="32bit"
