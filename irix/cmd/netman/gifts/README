-------------------

As part of the NetVisualyzer product, contained in this directory are several
sample scripts that help illustrate some of the things that are possible
using the NetVisualyzer tools.  Remember, all files in 4Dgifts are here
for demonstration purposes and are unsupported by Silicon Graphics, Inc.

The information in the software listed below is subject to change without
notice and should not be construed as a commitment by Silicon Graphics, Inc.

1. cpapack

	cpapack is an example of a csh script that you might run out
	of your crontab each night.  It cycles through the NetCPA data
	directory given as an argument and runs netpack in any
	directories older than a certain number of years, months,
	or days.  If no argument is given, the current directory
	is used.

	WARNING:  The script uses the -r option to netpack which
	removes the original data files when the directory is packed.


2. tospread

	tospread is a nawk script that converts a report generated
	with "netaccount -s 0 filename > reportfile" or
	"netaccount -t filename > reportfile" to a tab-separated
	format that can be incorporated into most spreadsheets.
	To use this script, run "nawk -f tospread reportfile > spreadfile".
	The file "spreadfile" can than be read into your spreadsheet.


3. loadncp

	loadncp is a sh script that can download a DECnet network database
	across the network.  All node entries in the remote database with
	a matching area number are copied to the local database.  Only
	address-name pairs are copied to the local database, entries
	with a matching area number but without a name are not copied.
	This program assumes that 4DDN has been installed and has been
	started.  You must be su to successfully execute.  To use this
	script, as root run "./loadncp remote-node area-numer" where
	remote-node is the DECnet node to retrieve the database from
	and area-number is the DECnet area to retrieve.
