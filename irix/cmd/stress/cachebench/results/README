BENCHMARK RESULTS

Since the datasets take up a signifigant amount of disk space,
try to follow this procedure when checking in:

  1. tar the config file and the dataset directory.
  2. gzip the tar file.
  3. Check in with the -ko option to p_finalize, to ensure that the
     binary is not corrupted.

As with unixperf results, it is strongly suggested that results
checked in here should be taken on a dedicated machine, after running
the startup script (ensure that processors are isolated, etc.)

    These files contain the datasets used in the 8/20/97 Legoperf
    presentation.  Data was gathered for a 28 processor Challenge and
    a 32 processor Origin 2000, for the fetch_add and store
    operations.
