Pthread Test Code Directory

	A collection of pthread tests.  Some are portable.

Running tests:

	Make will build and run tests using the libraries and headers
	from the $ROOT tree so make sure the relevent headers and
	libraries are installed first.

	Each test subdirectory Makefile has the following options:

	$ make
		default,
		buildall	build tests in all formats
		build		build tests in default format
		run		build and run tests in default format
		runall		build and run tests in all formats

	Output goes to fd 2.


Subdirectories:

	sanity/
		Specific verification.

	stress/
		Repeated exercise.

	lib/
		Utility functions for benchmarking and verification.

Adding tests:
	Copy existing test code.
		Sanity tests have special structure (e.g. no main()).
	Use the macros from lib/Tst.h and lib/Chk.h.
		Check all returns.
		Avoid printfs.

	Create a subdir and a Makefile using the notes in mk.common.
	Add the subdir name to the SUBDIR lists in the main Makefile
	and runtest.sh.

	If special params are required by a test create a shell script
	to run it - see prodSume in stress/ for an example.
