These are the stress test programs:
  DV	   data verification; copies random files of data across TCP and
	   UNIX-domain sockets, using randomly-sized writes, and verifies that
	   it was transferred correctly
  Gfx	   graphics (if present)
  IO	   I/O (raw disk, serial I/O)
  Ipc	   basic semaphore, message and shared memory
  Istress  general filesystem
  Misc	   miscellaneous system services
  Pigs	   tests that grow the stack deep, then exercise syscalls
  Sproc	   multithreaded user applications
  Vm	   virtual memory
  Mmap	   mapped memory
  Fdpass   AF_UNIX file-descriptor passing stress
  Net	   AF_INET socket (TCP/UDP) stress
  Select   socket/select stress
  Tli	   TLI (inet/loopback STREAM) stress test
  Usock	   AF_UNIX (STREAM/DGRAM) socket stress

To run the whole series of tests type "run iterations" in this directory.  The
"iterations" value is an integer number of iterations of the test programs.
The stdout and stderr outputs are saved in directory Report.  To run one of 
the sets of tests, cd to a subdirectory and run "runtests iterations".

The -a option can be given for asynchronous operation - in this case,
the individual subdirectory tests are run in the background.
