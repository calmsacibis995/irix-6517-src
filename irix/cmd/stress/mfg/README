This directory contains the shell scripts and c code used in the extended
diagnostics.  In order to use this stuff, you need to build it and create
a directory on the test system called /usr/diags/os.  Then programs in
the bin subdirectory should be placed in /usr/diags/os/bin, and the scripts
should be placed in /usr/diags/os/scripts.

You can start the tests by using the do_ostests script.  This will start
the io, splock, and mem tests simultaneously.  To stop the tests, use the
stop_ostests script.  If desired, any one of the tests can be started or
stopped individually.
