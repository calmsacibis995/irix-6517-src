To Whom It May Concern -

   The file 'diskio.c' contains the diskio benchmark tool, which is 
capable of a wide range of tests on disks, from reading and writing
filesystems to raw disk partitions.  All behaviour is adjustable from
command line options, and the blocksizes to be used in a test may
be specified as arguments on the command line.  The file 'diskio.c'
contains documentation on the options available and the philosophy of
the test.  Although the comments in 'diskio.c' specify that BSD 4.2
is supported, the code currently doesn't work (yes, you're looking at
an interim version of the code ...).  The NOSEMS define does, however.

   The file 'diskio.sh' is a bourne shell script that I use locally to
run a fixed sequence of benchmarks.  You should adjust sizes and number
of processes in this file to insure that the buffer cache never has a
chance to buffer data on a program's behalf, e.g.,

	(number of process) X (file size) >> (buffer cache size)

   The output is in the format I'd like to see these things in.  If you
want, use the -V option to 'diskio.sh', and you will get minimal output,
which with minor munging can be directly imported into a spreadsheet or
other program of your choice.

   Suggestions and comments are always welcome, but the management reserves
the right to refuse to add 'features'.
