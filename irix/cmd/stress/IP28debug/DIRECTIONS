# Use as following
dis kernelname > dis
cat dis | ./t5block > branchtarg.tmp
cat branchtarg.tmp | sort -u > branchtarg
cat dis | ./t5spec > t5.out
cat t5.out | grep '^-,' | awk '{ printf ( "%s\n", $4 ) ; }' | sort -u > allfuncs

# t5block does branch target analysis to find all basic blocks
#  these must be in sorted order for the t5spec script to locate them properly
# t5spec checks for barriers preceding all unsafe stores
#  this script attempts to get rid straightforward ll/sc loops to reduce
#  output, but only does so in simple cases
#  prefetch store hints are also checked
#  These scripts might not be perfect, but they should be a major help in
#  targeting potential problem areas.
