master [num_processes [num_iterations [shmget_key] ] ]

-----------------------

master is a supervisor program which sets up a shared memory segment and
synchronizes the execution of num_processes mutex32 and mutex64 programs.
There are an equal number of each process, unless num_processes is odd, in
which case there will be one more mutex64.  There may be up to 32
num_processes.  num_iterations sets how many iteration of each test to
conduct.  shmget_key is the key used to set up the shared memory segment.
The default values are as follows:

num_processes	= 2
num_iterations	= 25
shmget_key	= 0xdcbb

The system's mutex capabilities (as defined in <mutex.h> and <abi_mutex.h>)
pass if there are no messages.

The structure of this test is to have several 32-bit and 64-bit processes
fight for the same data structures, both with other processes of the same
addressibility, and with processes of different addressibility.  The test
is set up so that the master program synchronizes the child processes
to simultaneously do small subtests which each stress test some primitive.
The tests are set up so that any violation of mutual exclusion will be
detected (in some cases, it is possible, though highly improbable, that
violation of atomicity go undetected).
