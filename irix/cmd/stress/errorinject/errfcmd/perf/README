Files:

README.md          - Instructions and explanantion of md interface
README.io          - Instructions and explanantion of io interface

mdperfTest.c       - simple example code of how to get some md counts
ioperfTest.c       - simple example code of how to get some io counts

iobatch.c          - More complicated test program showing how to extract io
	  	     counts, good to examine for flexibility of
		     interface, and some more examples

all_iocount.txt    - output of iobatch for 4 - node machine while
		     monitoring all nodes
node0_iocounts.txt - output of iobatch for 4 - node machine while 
		     monitoring node 0

Makefile           - Shows what #defines are necessary

hwperftypes.h      - The offsets, includes, return values and other goodies to 
		     use the interface.


Notes:

1) The code will not compile on any kernel but the one I have built,
since I haven't checked it in. It is just there for reference.

2) The overflow bug in md should be fixed now.

If there are any questions or problems please e-mail me at mhr@engr.sgi.com

Also if anyone has a program that is using the ioctl interface please
tell me so I can test it out with my changes.
