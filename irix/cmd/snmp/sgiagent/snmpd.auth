########################################################################
#
# This file tells the snmpd daemon which community strings to accept 
# or reject. See the file /etc/snmpd.trap.conf to specify whether a trap
# should be sent when an invalid community string is received.
#
# The format of authorization rules for snmpd is:
#
# 	action  host:community/operation ...
#
# where:
#
# 'action' is either "accept" or "reject" (case insensitive).  It is
#	followed by a list of entries.
#
# 'host' is a comma separated list of host names, Internet addresses, or
#	a "*" meaning all hosts.
#
# 'community' is a comma separated list of SNMP communities or a "*"
#	meaning all communities.
#
# 'operation' is a comma separated list of operations allowed to this
#	entry.  Valid operations are "get" and "set".
#
#
#  Examples:
#  --------
#
#	accept	*:public/get
#		Accept get operations for the community "public" from
#		any host.  This is the default set below.
#
#	accept	localhost:icanset
#		Accept all operations (get and set) from the local host
#		with the community "icanset".
#
#	reject	*:*/set
#		Reject all set operations.
#

accept	*:public/get
