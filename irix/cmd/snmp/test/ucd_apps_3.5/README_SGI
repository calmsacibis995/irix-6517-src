U.C.Davis SNMP Package

* The test applications have been built from U.C.Davis SNMP 3.5 source code.
* All of the applications are o32, so that they can run on any 6.[2345]
  machine.

TESTING
-------
The SNMP applications require all the mib files to be concatenated into a 
single mib.txt file.  The mibs/mib.txt directory contains the basic MIB-II
and the SGI enterprise mib files.

SETUP
-----
Let's say that the SNMP applications are copied in this directory :
	~/ucdapps

You need to copy the mib.txt file to 
	~/ucdapps/mibs

And set the environment variable MIBS to ALL :
	setenv MIBS ALL

And set the environment variable MIBDIRS to ~/ucdapps/mibs
	setenv MIBDIRS ~/ucdapps/mibs

Once this setup is done, then any of the snmp applications can be used.
