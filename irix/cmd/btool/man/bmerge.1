.B bmerge
is a reporting program of the branch coverage tool. It merges the
contents of \fIlog_file_name1\fR and \fIlog_file_name2\fR (etc.) to the
standard output.
.LP
Merging means that the
counts for true/false of every branch in the output is equal to the sum
of the true/false counts of the same branch in all specified log files.
If only one file is named it will be copied onto standard output.

A maximum of 100 logfiles can be merged at a time.
