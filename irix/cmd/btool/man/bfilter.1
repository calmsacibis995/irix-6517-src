.SH NAME
bfilter \- filter out uninteresting lines from the branch log
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bfilter
[
.I -v
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B bfilter
takes as standard input the output from breport.  It copies its
standard input to standard output, removing all lines where no branch
was taken.  This is convenient for use with error(1) or the GNU Emacs
next-error function.
.sp
If the 
.I -v
option is given, 
.B bfilter
filters out the branches that were taken in both directions, so that
you can concentrate your attention on unexecuted code.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf

breport logfile | bfilter | error

.fi
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR breport (1),
.BR btool (1).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
