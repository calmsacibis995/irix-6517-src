	  but they have been removed for gonzo, bozo, sandpit and moomba)

M-05[T] base disk stats, jeffreyh@engr
	. Needs testing on larger machines, multiple IO4s and/or SCIPs disks.
	. Ania to do testing

?-08[ ] multiple IO4s and multiple SCIPs, tomf@trevose, cwr/jeremy

A-10[D] QA scripts for Irix-QA-Release people to use
	. automated scripts that sanity check libirixpmda instrumentation
	  against "reasonable" values and other irix tools.

# Deferred beyond ficus FCS (i.e. irix6.4-ssg)

DM-20[D] page migration, numa/nstats(1), lfsh@engr
	. need clarification of some some metrics ... some seem bogus
	  or not implemented
	. per-node memory usage metrics 
	  %free + %local + %repl + %lent == 100% ???
	  See sysmp(MPSA_NODE_INFO) in sysmp.h
	  - need to understand _what_ these mean
	  - numa_stats.pagealloc_lent_memory is in pages and is broken;
	    nar@engr posted bug #434711

M-25[D] hub (I/O counters broken in current version of hardware)
	. started trying to figure this out
	  need feedback on how to access hub registers in user mode.
	. MD (Memory Directory) registers ... 4-bit perfsel and 1-bit
	  perfenable ... 6 x 20-bit registers in silicon ... peg at
	  max
	. /dev/mem reader/writer -- NO
	. Jim Laudon is interested
	. no h/w interrupts ... kernel API under development [e-mail 10/14]

?-12[ ] needs vehicle to explain how to update PMNS for new IRIX metrics
	using /var/pcp/pmns/Rebuild
	  (a) at the PCP collector site, and
	  (b) at the PCP monitor site
	. eoe relnotes?  pcp_origin relnotes?

?-09[ ] If this happens, drop o32 format libirixpmda, else drop n32 format
       From:    Ben Fathi
       Date:    Wed Sep  4
       Subject: Re: 32-bit kernels from ficus tree
       yes, IP22. currently o32, supposed to be n32 by release time.

       Also mail from olson@engr: more than IP22 ... but same o32/n32 story

       . need to track this, and if n32 special care for QA'ing libirixpmda
       . are both o32/n32 installed on a 32-bit kernel (Speedo?)

?-??[X?] irix.mem units, bug #365244
	. issue is mem op counters versus mem space measures ... need
	  to check kernel source and review help text,
	  e.g. irix.mem.system.sptfree
	. this has been fixed in 6.2 according to closure text for #365244.

MD-??[D] PCP protocol extensions
	. protocol version (and byte order?)
	. authenication for unlicensed pmcd use by trusted irix apps
	  e.g. 3Dconsole, netstat, dkstat, etc. (leedom@asd.sgi.com)
	. Test implementation, as specified in mark's mail 30Sept96.

?-??[ ] environ pmda
	. needs review w.r.t. changes to syscntrld in ficus
	. lego systems may have multiple fans in multiple cabinets.
	. wait for syscntrld

?-??[ ] network stats, netstat(1), fischer@engr, vjs@engr
	. convert to avoid /dev/kmem for network interfaces
	. rfe #430097 to add multicast per-interface byte snd/rcv.
	  (currently needs to walk kmem if we do this).

?-??[ ] re-instate gfx instr (see gr_osview, Jonathan's mail, reuel@asd)
       also be aware of dmedia stuff in bonsai
       . osview and gr_osview still use kmem readers.

?-??[ ] xlv instr: according to geoff@engr this will be for XLV^2 which
       will not happen before kudzu MR

?-??[ ] SIGABRT -> named(1)

?-??[ ] HiPPI, by pass bug, fddistats(1)

?-??[ ] smt/apps/smtstat(1)

?-??[ ] cachefs, sun/cachefs/tools/cfsstat(1)

?-??[ ] grio, xfs/grio/griostat.h

?-??[ ] array, array/astat, astat(1)
	. syssgi(SGI_ENUMASHS) call to enumerate all ashes, rdb@homegrown.

?-??[ ] tlbstats 

?-??[ ] token ring, tokenring/trvis

?-??[ ] RSVP, bsd/rsvp/tools/rstat.c

?-??[ ] disk stats
	. node-level aggegation? <= disk:node map is computable

?-??[ ] reconcile, standardize and clean up startup messages when
	libirixpmda has a problem, e.g. on an IP19

?-??[ ] irix.kernel.all.cpu.active
	. irix.kernel.all.cpu.util would be better (intended to be the sum
	  of all the !idle && !wait time
	. scale to max of 100%, independent of no. of CPUs
	. also do percpu version

?-??[ ] memory tiles (Moosehead only?)

?-??[ ] xlv failover, SP/A and SP/B stats before and after failover
	. "pmstore irix.pmda.reset 1" in xlv failover?

?-??[ ] bridge
	. no h/w instr => no kernel ctrs? [e-mail 10/15]

?-??[ ] fiber channel disks, raster@engr
	. between Lego FCS and SCS
	. what is the IRIX delivery vehicle? ... IRIX 6.4 patch

?-??[ ] xbow, xbstat, biyabani@engr
	. conflict with rtmon use (event-trace) => T5 evctr-like scheme for
	  process-specific vs system-level usage being mutually exclusive
	. email dialog established with biyabani@engr, see
	  http://holodec.engr.sgi.com/~biyabani/README.xbmon

?-??[ ] disabled CPUs
	. is map xlate correct hinv-only IP19 and HWG systems
	. does it work for CPU disabled in PROM?
