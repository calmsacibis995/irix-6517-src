# library (all versions) commondefs for leaf makefiles

#
# Turn on only those flags here which affect all flavors of libraries
# including ABI libraries. non-generic flags must be turned on in the
# relavent versiondefs files. For example _SGI_MP_SOURCE is defined in specific
# versiondefs files since it does not apply to ABI libraries.
#
#
# The tokens inside the #pragma's in math.h aren't substituted for, so
# that when one includes synonyms.h which re-defines some of the functions
# to '_'func, the compiler spits out warnings since the declaration gets
# munged to the new name but the pragma doesn't.. Since we in libc don't
# really call the math functions much, we just ignore the optimization
# effects of the NO_SIDE_EFFECTS.
#
# We undefine __INLINE_INSTRINSICS - this helps in 2 ways:
# 1) we avoid silly "marked as intrinsic as it not declared as a function"
#	warnings due to the fact that we always call the '_' version of
#	of a function, which the pragma doesn't understand.
# 2) we want to be able to preempt these symbols in some cases.
