This directory contains the PROM code common to both the IP19 and
IP21 (Blackbird) processor boards.  After the procesor-specific code
in the processor-board proms executes, the IP proms download this
code from the IO4 into main memory and proceed to execute it.

The intent is that this code should run without change on both the IP19 
and IP21 processors.  For this reason, processor-specific code sequences 
should be selected dynamically.  IFDEF's MUST NOT BE USED.
