Debug Monitor Memory Test Descriptions
======================================

Aina Test - This test performs the Address in Address Test algorithm.
By default this test is run against memory between the addresses
"FIRST_ADDR" and "LAST_ADDR" which by default are Kseg1 address. The test
address range can be increased or decreased by using the menu commands
"fa" and "la" to set the address range. These address need not be
in Kseg1 space, i.e 0xAxxxxxxxx. 

For example, if you want to run this test against the cache and memory
you can set the addresses to be cached addresses (Kseg0), i.e. 0x8xxxxxxx.
These tests can also be targeted at any memory in the system by controlling
the "FIRST_ADDR" and "LAST_ADDR" parameters.
