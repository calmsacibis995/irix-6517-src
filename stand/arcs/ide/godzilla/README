			Godzilla README
			===============


This directory gathers all diags that are godzilla-architecture specific.

The following items are included:
- include: all diag header files  (with the format: d_filename.h)
- uif: all user interface files such as msg_printf, busy, status
- heart: level 1 heart ASIC diags
- bridge: level 1 bridge ASIC diags
- heart_bridge: bridge/heart level 1 system diags
- ecc: ecc tests, using ecc correction and ecc diag capabilities in heart/uP
- mem: memory tests, involving programming of the memory controller in heart
- xbow: level 1 xbow ASIC diags 

A bit of history
----------------
The initial emulation system does not have a crossbow, hence the heart 
is directly connected to the bridge, in a "direct-connect" mode.
This explains why there is a heart_bridge directory.
