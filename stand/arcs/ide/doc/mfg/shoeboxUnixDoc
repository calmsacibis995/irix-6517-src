									UNIX DIAGS FOR SHOEBOX

The unix diagnostic strategy is to use Fiber Channel cards by Adaptec to test the 64 bit
capability of the pci shoebox. Three cards are required to run the test

The diagnostic puts pass/fail messages in console or cu window only. If you
run diag from a unix window then results are put into SYSLOG. Do not run
diag from  unix window.

Do not insert/remove fiber channel connectors with the power on. This may
damage system under test (sut).

shoebox
-------
There are two tests conducted. The first test verifies that the FC driver properly 
initializes the cards. The second test conducts a 64 bit dma test. Data is looped via a 
loopback connector and verified.

Data flows from main memory, to heart, to xbow, to bridge (shoebox), emerald chip, card sram,
and back the opposite way.

Usage: shoebox
Test Requirements: loopback connector.
