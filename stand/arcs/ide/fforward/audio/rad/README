IDE Manufacturing diagnostics README: 

These tests have all been verified under RADigo (RAD in IP22).

RadCspaceTest: Test the Configuration space registers in RAD.  The -v
option prints out rev information about the RAD board.

RadRamTest: Test Read/Write RAM registers for RAD. The -v option
prints verbose information.  

RadUtils: Utility functions for setup and timing used throughout the
RAD tests.

RadStatusTest: Test Status dma in both single shot and retrigger mode.
For diagnostics you would only want to do single-shot.

RadDMATest: This test right now is "pseudo-functional", it does DMAs
through RAD interfaces in a variety of directions and loops.  Since it
was used only for bringup, it doesn't have any signal verification.
With some modifications the test can be incorporated into the mfg
diags.

RadOscillator: Contains all the routines to implement multi-channel
sine waves without assistance of the math libraries.
