	Contents of VDMA test for LIGHT:

	lg1_cflush.c - test cache flushing VDMA; explicitly skip the 
			default mode setting and exercise all VDMA registers.

	lg1_cxtsw.c - test VDMA context switching by saveing and restoring
		   context for VDMA and REX1.  write-pixel DMA's were used 
		   here.

	lg1_defregs.c - test default register setting for VDMA, ie.,
			only DMA_MEMADRD and DMA_GIO_ADRS were used.

	lg1_dmafill.c - test fill mode memory write.

	lg1_stride.c - test positive/negative (up/down) stride VDMA.

	lg1_mask.c - test VDMA gio address masking.

	lg1_onereg.c - test VDMA triggered by using only one register 
		     DMA_MEMADRDS.

	lg1_stpstrt.c - test stop/restart VDMA.

	lg1_vtop.c - test 6 VDMA interrupts(DMA_CAUSE), and the correctness 
		  of virtual to physical address conversion in VDMA was also 
		  verified here.

	lg1_yzoom.c - test y-zoomed VDMA.

	lg1_skpbyte.c - test none-zero skip byte VDMA.

	We are skipping the test for address decrementing DMA, since
	REX1 could not support none word aligned true address decrementing
	DMA.  

	NOTE: lg1_probe need to run first to initialize the gfx board for		      the VDMA test.
	      You don't have to reset/initialize the gfx board for every
	      VDMA test as long as you know the gfx is still running., ie.,
	      not hang by running your VDMA test.
