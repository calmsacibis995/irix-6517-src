	Contents of VDMA test for EXPRESS:

	gr2_cflush.c - test cache flushing VDMA; explicitly skip the 
			default mode setting and exercise all VDMA 
			registers.

	gr2_cxtsw.c - test VDMA context switching by saveing and restoring
		   context saved by VDMA.  Display bus DMA to VC1
		   sram was used here. 

	gr2_defregs.c - test default register setting for VDMA, ie.,
			only DMA_MEMADRD and DMA_GIO_ADRS were used.

	gr2_dmafill.c -  test fill-mode memory write DMA (shared the file
			with LIGHT, since it does not involve the
			graphics)

	gr2_stride.c -  test positive/negative stride DMA, so that 
			bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom pixel DMA
			can be implemented for EXPRESS. (# 2D pixels)

	gr2_mask.c - test GIO address masking.

	gr2_onereg.c - (### command FIFO needed for coding )

	gr2_stpstrt.c - test stop/restart VDMA by DMAing to color map.

	gr2_vtop.c - test 6 VDMA interrupts(DMA_CAUSE), the correctness 
		  of conversion from virtual to physical address in
		  VDMA also verified here. (# 2D pixels)

	gr2_yzoom.c - test y-zoomed VDMA.

	gr2_skpbyte.c -  test skip-byte VDMA; color map loading was
			 used here.

	gr2_decreadr.c - test word-aligned decrementing address VDMA.

	NOTE: gr2_initsys need to run first to initialize the gfx board for		      the VDMA test.
	      You don't have to reset/initialize the gfx board for every
	      VDMA test as long as you know the gfx is still running., ie.,
	      not hang by running your VDMA test.
