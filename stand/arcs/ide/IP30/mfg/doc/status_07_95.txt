		Diagnostics Schedules and Milestones
		====================================
Goal:	To help Engg bring up R4K/T5/Heart/Bridge/XBOW emulators(10/31/95)
	To provide diags for the function tests at the vendor	(11/31/95)
	To provide stress tests for speed racer system at SGI	(01/31/96)

What has been done so far ? (07/21/95)
--------------------------------------
   	o Heart level 0 & 1 bring up tests 	- coded and compiled
   	o Bridge level 0 & 1 bring up tests	- coded and compiled
   	o Memory and ECC tests			- coded and compiled
   	o R4K cache and tlb tests		- ported and compiled
	o A preliminary evaluation of MDK 
	o Set up a forum to share T5 diags with HE mfg.


Krishna: Responsible for Diags for IP30, PCI and Front Plane
------------------------------------------------------------

What needs to be done? 
----------------------

by 08/04/95:
-----------
o Review ALL bring up tests for the emulator
o Investigate the COSIM availability for diags
o Investigate IOC3 bring up diags from Engg
o Strategy for testing IOC3 and XBOW (work with HE diag folks)
o Bridge PCI test plan ready
o Front Plane function tests 
o CPR software design and implementation (get started)
o Audio diagnostics plan (at least get started)

If emulator is ready to run diags by 08/04/95 
	*** Activity A ***	(4 weeks)
	o bring up R4K cache and tlb tests		08/11/95
	o bring up Heart level 0 and 1 tests		08/11/95
	o bring up Memory and ECC tests			08/18/95
	o bring up Bridge diags 			08/18/95
	o bring up PCI diags				08/25/95
else if COSIM is available for diags by 08/04/95
	*** Activity B ***	(4 weeks)
	o bring up Heart level 0 and 1 tests on COSIM	08/11/95
	o bring up ECC tests on COSIM			08/11/95
	o bring up Bridge level 0 and 1 tests on COSIM	08/18/95
	o bring up PCI tests on COSIM			08/18/95
else
	*** Activity C ***	(4 weeks)
	o implement bridge PCI tests			08/11/95
	o finalize front plane functions tests		08/18/95
	o complete audio diags plan			08/18/95
	o finalize (or even the plan) for XBOW		08/25/95
  The order of priority in the activities:
    A, B, C

By 10/31/95, we expect to complete all of the above mentioned activities...


Herve:	Responsible for PM, T5, MDK
-----------------------------------
What needs to be done?
----------------------

by 08/04/95:
-----------
o Work with Shiva bring up group and identify T5 bring up issues
o Communicate the questions/concerns/issues of MDK to HE mfg team
o Identify tests at MTI that are candidates for T5 Simulation/Emulation
o Start reading Heart Spec (preparation for porting T5 tests)

If emulator is ready to run diags by 08/04/95
	*** Activity D ***
	o bring up R4K cache and tlb tests              08/11/95
	o Port T5 - Uniprocessor tests from MTI		08/25/95
	  (tests must run under COSIM environment)
	o Port T5 - Multiprocessor tests from MTI	09/08/95
	  (tests must run under COSIM environment)
else 
	*** Activity F ***
	o Port T5 - Uniprocessor tests from MTI		08/18/95
	  (tests must run under COSIM environment)
	o Port T5 - Multiprocessor tests from MTI	09/01/95
	  (tests must run under COSIM environment)

	if emulator is ready to run T5 diags in this period
	     *** Activity E ***
	o Port T5 - Uniprocessor tests from MTI		????
	  (tests must run under emulation environment)
	o Port T5 - Multiprocessor tests from MTI	????
	  (tests must run under emulation environment)
   The order of priority in the activities:
      D, E, F

By 10/31/95, we expect to complete all of the above mentioned activities...
