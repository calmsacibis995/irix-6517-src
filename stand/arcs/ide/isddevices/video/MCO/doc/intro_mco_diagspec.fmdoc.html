<P>
<A NAME="177375">The purpose of this document is to describe the 
diagnostic test plan which will be used to identify and isolate 
hardware problems with the Multi-Channel Output (MCO) board.</A></P>
<P>

<A NAME="177376"><U>1.1 Goals</U></A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="177377">Based on experience with the earlier video option 
boards, quantitative goals will be set for the following areas:</A></P>
<DD>
<A NAME="177378">Time to fail</A>
<DD>
<A NAME="177379">Time to repair</A>
<P>
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="177381"><U>1.2 Assumptions</U></A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="177382">It is assumed that the manufacturing process for the 
MCO board will be essentially identical to the current process used to 
manufacture other video option boards on the Indigo2 line. Boards are 
quickly tested in the functional test area with ``captured'' disk 
drives and then are sent to pack-out. </A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="177384">Failed MCO boards are sent to the board repair area 
(Board RA) where the boards are debugged and repaired.</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="177385"><U>1.3 Strategy</U></A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="177386">Diagnostics tests will be written to check the 
operation of each of the functional areas of the MCO. </A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="177387">The standalone ide program will be the primary program 
used to exercise graphics functionality. The Unix-level suite of tests, 
systest, may use Unix-level commands, (e.g. setmon) to verify MCO 
functionality, but the focus of the testing will in the standalone ide 
area.</A></P>
<P>
<A NAME="177373">The following chapters present a deailed list of the 
tests/areas-to-test which we plan to use to diagnose the MCO board.</A></P>
