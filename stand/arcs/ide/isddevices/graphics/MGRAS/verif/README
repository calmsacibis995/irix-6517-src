How to generate an output array file and checksum for the texture drawing
tests:

1. Run save.csh the existing *.cmou files and *.h and *.c files for reference. 

2. Run the doit_c_files.csh script to copy over new csim_in.bin and spec files if you need a new *.c file
	(Most of the time you won't need this step since we're only doing
	new header files)

3. Run the doit_h_files.csh script to create new header files for the texture
	tests. The script will do the following in each directory:


	% aviewit -x <x-val> -y <y-val> -h <h-val> -w <w-val> -z -o

	This will create a file called out.h which is an array of the expected
	pixel values. Below is a table of values to use for the switches:

	
	directory	x-val	y-val	h-val	w-val
	---------------------------------------------
	debug_8Khigh	196	221	291	98
	debug_8Kwide	220	196	98	292
	debug_detail	38	39	284	436
	debug_mag	144	208	159	224
	line_gl_sc	220	220	72	72
	load		196	207	128	98
	lut4d		0	0	256	256
	mddma		0	0	256	256
	persp1		194	194	98	124
	scis_tri_i	195	195	100	100
	tex1d		94	65	482	426
	tex3d		206	206	100	100
	opt43		0	0	40	40
	

	b. Modify the out.h file to have the correct name of the array inside the file.

	c. cp out.h to the proper named file (e.g. if you're in debug_8Khigh, the file
	to copy to is mgras_tex_bordertall_out.h)

4. Type "mgl3" and Compile test6.c (cc -o test6 test6.c) and run it to get the 
	calculated checksum.

5. Modify mgras_tetramfunc.c with the new checksum value.
