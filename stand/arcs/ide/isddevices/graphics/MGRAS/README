Following changes are made to the source file structure:

Makefile Changes:
=================
o Enabled warnings while compiling (i.e., removed -w from the compile option)

Header File CHanges:
====================
o All constants are kept in a new file called "mgras_const.h"
o All macros are kept in a new file called "mgras_macro.h"
o All prototype definitions (for funcions and variables) are kept in a new
  file called "mgras_proto.h"
o mgras_hq3.h & mgras_dma.h are empty files.
o mgras_diag.h includes all of the newly created header files
	This was necessary inorder to eliminiate all the compiler warnings
  and cleanup the code.

Source File Changes:
====================
o As far as possible, all constans, macros and prototypes are moved
  to appropriate header files.
o Simulation-related stuff are removed in most of the places
o Several typos and incorrect declarations have been fixed.
o Corrected code that performs arithmetic on pointers and addresses.
  This was needed to make the code work with 64-bit compiler.
  A new data type has been defined: __paddr_t - which is a 64-bit quantity
  while using a 64-bit compiler and a 32-bit quantity while using a 32-bit
  compiler. It's defined in mgras_const.h

Tips for changing files in this area:
====================================
o Do NOT tag-along to previous trees such as 5.2isd_mfg, 6.2isd_mfg, banyan.
o Use __paddr_t to perform pointer arithmetic
o Use mgras_const.h, mgras_macro.h and mgras_proto.h to define constants,
  macros and prototypes respectively. Do NOT define them in source code.
