New README as things work on real systems now.  Just bootp()xxx:dprom.IP30.DBG,
it's important that the name end in .DBG.  'setenv dbgstop 1' works as ^A
doesn't always work in init code so you have to be careful.  ^A works once
you get the IO system set-up, usually when the command monitor is up.

Also take a look at shell.ide.DBG...
