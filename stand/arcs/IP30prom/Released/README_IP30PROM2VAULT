Instructions for releasing the IP30prom to the 'vault':

What mfg wants is the following files:

fprom
IP30prom.bin
IP30prom.hex
README.IP30.PROM

under directory <SGIPN> where the product no. for IP30prom is:
070-1485-005. Note that last 3 digits (005) is the rev and
will be increment on each release to the vault.

(1) Replace the obvious files with the new ones.
    You now need to edit README.IP30.PROM, update:

        Date: (version output of prom)
        Checksum: run 'hexsum < IP30prom.hxe' 
		  and use the last 4 digits of the 1MB #.
		  hexsum executable is in IP30prom/Released
        SGIPN: increment the rev (i.e. -004 -> -005)

(2) Add notes for changes for the new PROM (i.e. whats new with -005).

    The files fprom, IP30prom.bin, and README.IP30.PROM are archived
    in stand/arcs/IP30prom/Released. IP30prom.hex is renamed version
    of IP30prom.hxe which can be made from stand/arcs/IP30prom/Makefile
    (i.e. see the make rules for IP30prom.hxe).

    NOTE: IP30prom.hxe is NOT a typo. This is the byte swapped
    (16bit-wise) version of IP30prom.hex which is no longer used
    by mfg. But rename IP30prom.hxe to IP30prom.hex when
    copying file over to mari.mfg:/usr/tmp/<SGIPN>


(3) Talk to dilip and tell him it's comming, and notify:

    maggiew@mfg.sgi.com     Margaret White  933-1725  12L-560

    Her machine is mari.mfg.  Make a dir /usr/tmp/<SGIPN> and put those 4 files
    in, making sure to chmod 777 everything.  Do this as guest.
