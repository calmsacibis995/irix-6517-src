			EAROM Information
			----- -----------

The IP19 EAROM contains the R4000 serial bit and a number of important
constants which are needed by the IP19 prom.

The file earom.dat contains the actual data to be burned into the IP19
EAROM.  This file is human-readable; to actually convert it into a form
readable by the nprom program, it must be fed into the earomimg program.

To burn an IP19 EAROM:

	1.  Type 'make' to generate an earomimg executable from the
	    earomimg.c file.

	2.  Login to the prom burning station.  
 
	3.  Put an EAROM chip into the dataio prom burner.

	4.  Type 'burn_earom earom.img' 

	5.  When the script completes, the EAROM should be done.
