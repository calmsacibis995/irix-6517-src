		IP27prom/doc Directory

The "html" subdirectory contains the official ip27prom hypertext document.

Whenever an important modification is made, the modifications should be
exported to the public by copying the contents of "html" subdirectory
to the official NSD document repository under

	babylon:/var/www/htdocs/lego/ip27prom/.

The "support" subdirectory contains showcase files that were used to
generate some of the GIF images, and helper scripts.

Generally, the procedure for going from a showcase file to a GIF is:
1.  Run showcase print to file command and generate file.ps
2.  Run ps2ppm file.ps, to generate file.ppm (via Ghostscript)
3.  Use "xv" to crop the ppm down to the bare graphics
    with a one-pixel border, and save as GIF (file.gif).
4.  Run imgworks and choose File/GIF Options/Set Transparency Color
    (make background transparent).

Note:	Images should not use white or very light colors since they
	disappear when the image is printed.
