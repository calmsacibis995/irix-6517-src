myacc
-----

This is a version of Yacc modified to produce modular output.
Instead of relying on global variables, it stores all variables
in a structure.  The names of all generated and utilized
functions, types, defines, and file names are prefixed with a
module name and underscore.

Myacc is used to build the IP27prom parser without using any
global data (stack only).  It can also be used to include more
than one parser in a single application.
