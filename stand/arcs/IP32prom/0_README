Note that the IP32 directory is layed out differently from the other
platform directories.  The goal is to isolate as much as possible the
work going on in the IP32 area from the rest of the stand tree.  Once
the IP32 code is stable, some of the contents of this directory tree
will probably be merged into the main portion of the stand tree.
