The 4.8 prom image was built from the patch3015 sources and the bonsai
(irix6.3) treees.  The build was done on an Indy running Irix 6.2
with the following env - 
SHELL=/bin/ksh
PRODUCT=4DMH
ROOT=/disk06/patch2039/root
TOOLROOT=/hosts/babylon/usr/dist/new_toolroots/6.3/os/mr/ptoolroot

The ROOT was installed from /hosts/babylon/usr/dist/new_toolroots/6.3/os/mr/
and updated with the modified header file IP32.h checked into patch2039.


Patch 3015 contains a checked in version of the census file in 
isms/stand/arcs/IP32prom/images/census for each version of the
prom built from that tree.

------------

4.9 prom image is from patch3106. While 4.9 maybe the binary for
3106 their is chance that it might not. Since the R12000
and ARSENIC h/w have not be finalized there is a small chance
4.10 would be needed to support the h/w. But we need to put
4.9 in 6.5.1m and hope for the best.

SHELL=/bin/csh
PRODUCT=4DMH
ROOT=/hosts/babylon/usr/dist/new_toolroots/6.3/os/bonsai/ptoolroot/
TOOLROOT= images install from /hosts/babylon/usr/dist/new_toolroots/6.3/os/bonsai/toolroot (compiler 6.21)
WORKAREA=/hosts/femto/work/d3/patch3106

3106 is fixed up such that it nolonger needs the IP32.h update from
patch2039.

-------------

4.11 - Support for QED RM5271 cpu.

-------------

4.13 - Added support for TREX Shrink frequencies from bug 695095: 'Need
       PROM/kernel support for TREX Shrink speeds on O2.'  Also, removed
       the ability of 'setenv -f' to override read-only environment
       from bug 693845: 'O2 PROM 'setenv -f' can override readonly
       environment variables'
