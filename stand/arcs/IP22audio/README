This directory contains some standalone programs for bringing up and testing
the IP22 audio system.  I've gone through some of them and made them work
on near-mr level Indigo 2's.  (I still haven't seen an MR level Indigo 2).
The files below that have descriptions appear to work.  You're on your
own with the rest.  If you test others you should check your fixes in and
add brief descriptions to the list.
