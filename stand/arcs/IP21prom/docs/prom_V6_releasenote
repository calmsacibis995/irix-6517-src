Acceptance test log:

Notes:
	The only change compared to Version 5 is the CC write gatherer
	test error report is taken out for now due to random fails on
	hardware.
	We found a bug in Version 5 that write gatherer buffer memory
	used for slot 14 trashed slot 0 memory.  We change the IP21addrs.h
	move the UNIX address so that write gatherer test has enough
	memory.
