			IP21 PROM VERSION 2 RELEASE NOTE

From: Sue Liu x31801
Date: May 6, 94

NEW FEATURES:

	- CC join diag performed for every processor. When CC test fails,
	  IP21prom will continue, associated CPU will be disabled.
	  CC join diag on slave processor will be invoked based on different
	  time delay. The delay time is calculated by the slot/cpu number
	  left shift 18 bit.

	- FPU (floating point functionality test) performed on 
	  every processor.

	- CC write gatherer diag temporarily is commented out due
	  to known hardware bug.

	- ICACHE test performed for every processor.

	- stag and staga commands are added in POD commands. They dump
	  the various scache tag information.

	- setpg and showpg commands in POD mode are used to set and show 
	  page size

	- gparity command in POD mode is used for scache parity test.

	- CPU speed is set to 75 MHz.

	- updated C0_CONFIG icache field to revision number mapping to match
          real hardware

	- EAROM data is up-to-date.
 
REMOVE FEATURES:

	- WRITE_EXTENED, READ_EXTENDED, SCACHE commands are removed from 
	  POD command mode. WRITE_EXTENED and READ_EXTENED only apply to
	  32 bit data. SCACHE test in IP21prom involves complicated
	  scache tag setup, to run it in POD mode may modify the IP21prom
	  states, so this test is not available from POD mode.

	- SLOAD, SRUN and PLOAD commands are removed from POD mode.

BUG FIXED:

	- scache hang problem fixed.

	- CC join bug fixed.

	- FPU test bug fixed.

	- NVRAM checksum bug fixed.


Notes:
	- Before IP21prom reaches CC uart output stage, ICACHE test,
	  scache ram size check, IU & FPU data path test are added,
	  if test fails, proper LED value will be displayed.

	- EV_ECCENB_LOC is removed from EAROM,it's only for R4400.

	- EV_CACHE_SZ_LOC is removed, in IP21prom, scache size value is
	  stored in a CC register.

Misc:
	prom_V2_accept file logs the IP21prom system bring up and POD commands
	test result on Sherman (2 processors) machines.
