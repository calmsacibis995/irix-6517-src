	Master Mode
	-----------
1.  Make sure we can boot to prompt using EPC UART.
2.  Make sure we can boot to prompt using SysCtlr UART.
3.  Type 'info' and verify output.
4.  Use 'dmc' to verify memory board operation.
5.  Do a 'wd a0000000 12345678'.
6.  Do a 'dd a0000000'.  Make sure value is 12345678.
7.  Do a 'dh a0000004'.  Make sure value is 1234.
8.  Do a 'db a0000000'.  Step through the values making sure information is
    correct.
9.  Do a 'dx 0 0'.  Make sure you get back 12345678
10. Do a 'mem a0010000 a0040000'.  Make sure test passes.
11. Do a 'dc cpuslot 0'.  Make sure that the correct flags are set for
    having three processors on.
12. Do a 'wd b8000010 1'.  Machine should reset.

13. Type 'big 0'.  This should change the machine to little-endian.
14. Type 'reset'.  On power on the header should have an (LE) after it.
    Make sure it changes the endianess of the other processors in the
    system.
15. Do a 'wd a0000000 12345678'. 
16. Do a 'dd a0000000'. 
17. Do a 'dh a0000000'.  Make sure that it first prints '5678', followed
    by '1234' when you hit return.
18. Do a 'info' again.
19. Do a 'mem a0010000 a0040000'.  Make sure it still passes.
20. Do a 'big 1' and a 'reset'.

21. Type 'scache 1' and make sure test passes.

22. Type 'loop 4 (dmc a)'.  The data from dmc should be printed 4 times.

23. Type 'loop 0 (dmc a)'.  Make sure the error message is printed.

24. Type 'dc 0 0'.  You should get a general exception with the cause
    as <Data Bus Err>.  There should be an 'A Chip MyResp drsc tout'
    Error/Timeout value set.
25. Press return.  The Error/Timeout message should be repeated.
26. Type 'clear'. Press Return twice.  The Error/Timeout message should
    stop being displayed.
27. Type 'reset'.

28. Type 'dd a0000001'.  You should get an exception immediately.
29. Type 'reset'. 

30. Type 'j bfc00008'.  The IO4 PROM should be downloaded and executed.
    Reset the system.

31. Type 'io'.  Make sure that the IO4 PROM gets loaded correctly.

*** Test niblet.
*** Test slaves.  Make sure they take interrupts correctly.  Make sure
	they switch to the IO4 PROM slave loop.
*** Test the DIAGVAL, PODMODE, and MANUMODE debug switches.
