New features:
	- Add DB chip test pattern decoding into Write gatherer diag.
	  When write gatherer diag fails, it will report which DB chip
	  fails.

	- Add gcache tag ram SIMM module decoding routine. When
	  gcache tag ram test, it will report which SIMM fails.

	- Report the first diagnostic error detected from Slave
	  to Master.

	- Add gcache parity POD cmd, one for default range test,
	  one for selected range test.

	- reorder the test sequence of io4 map ram test and memory
	  configuration test. When memory test fails, it will continue
	  cc join and write gatherer test then drop into POD mode.

BUG Fixed:
 	- Fixed Gcache tag ram test bug.

	- Fix the unknown diag code return from Slave bug.

	- Fix the bug that can not boot from slave processor.

	POD commands test result on stimpy(MP 2 processor system)

Note: 
	Running niblet in manufacture mode will print out pass/fail
	message to system controller. If not running in manufacture
	mode, currently pass/fail message will not be displayed on
	system controller console.
