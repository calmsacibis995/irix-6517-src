NAME
     PC 386/486


INTRODUCTION
     This manual entry provides board-specific information neces-
     sary to run VxWorks.  Verify that the board runs in the fac-
     tory configuration using  vendor-supplied  ROMs  and  jumper
     settings and checking the RS-232 connection.


BOOT ROMS
     There is a boot diskette instead  of  boot  ROMs.  The  boot
     diskette  includes  the boot sector, which is sector 0. Also
     it includes a boot rom image which is named "bootrom.sys" in
     the   DOS   file   system.  The  boot  rom  image  could  be
     "bootrom_uncmp" or "vxWorks.st(built with  BOOTABLE  defined
     in config.h)".  After booting standalone VxWorks, initialize
     the network using the function usrNetInit().


     The boards do not have a non-volatile RAM; thus, boot param-
     eters are not preserved whenever the system is powered off.


     To load  VxWorks,  and  for  more  information,  follow  the
     instructions  in  the Getting Started chapter of the Tornado
     Programmer's Guide.


DEVICES
     The  i8250Serial.c  I8250   UART   (Universal   Asynchronous
     Receiver  Transmitter)  tty  driver  is supplied for the two
     on-board serial ports;

     The chip drivers included are:
         i8253Timer.c - driver for i8253 timer chip.
         i8259Pic.c - Programmable Interrupt Controller library.
         nullNvRam.c - null ram library.

     A device driver for the on board Intel I8042 and I8048  key-
     board   controllers  is  provided.   The  INCLUDE_PC_CONSOLE
     directive  must  be  enabled   in   config.h.    The   macro
     PC_KBD_TYPE   should   be   defined   as  PC_PS2_101_KBD  or
     PC_XT_83_KBD  in  config.h.  Depending  on  this  definition
     either i8042Serial.c or i8048Serial.c is included.

     A device driver for the on board  Motorola  M6845  Vga  con-
     troller  is provided.  The INCLUDE_PC_CONSOLE directive must
     be enabled in config.h.

     A device driver for the IDE hard  disk  controller  is  pro-
     vided.    The  INCLUDE_IDE  directive  must  be  enabled  in
     config.h.

     A device driver for the nec765  floppy  disk  controller  is
     provided.   The  INCLUDE_FD  directive  must  be  enabled in
     config.h.

     The SMC Elite16 (Western Digital 8013WC) is  supported  with
     following jumper configuration:

         W1 - SOFT (IO Base Address 0x240)

         W2 - NONE/SOFT

         NO ROM

     The SMC Elite16 Ultra is  supported  with  following  jumper
     configuration:

         W1 - SOFT (IO Base Address 0x240)

         NO ROM


     The Intel EtherExpress16 is supported. This board  is  soft-
     configured with no jumpers.


     The 3Com EtherLinkIII is  supported.  This  board  is  soft-
     configured with no jumpers.


     The Novell/Eagle 2000 is supported. There're several  compa-
     tible  boards.   If the board is not soft-configured, the IO
     base address, memory address,  and  interrupt  level  should
     match those in config.h.


SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
     The valid auxiliary clock rates are between 2 and 2  to  the
     power of 13 (2^13 = 8192).
