This readme file contains brief explanations of the source code
included on the diskette labeled Source Disk V1.0.0.

Copy the following files into the corresponding destinations.
Be sure to use long files names (Windows 95) when appropriate.

FILE: CDIDEMO.C
DESTINATION: \tornado\target\config\pc486\
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This routine serves as an example of how to link a user defined
module into a vxWorks image.

User source code can be linked into vxWorks by listing the object
file name as part of the MACH_EXTRA definition found in the makefile
residing in \tornado\target\config\pc486.  In this case, cdidemo.o.

Cdidemo was written as a simple interface to other routines.  These
routine perform tasks such as sending data to the six serial ports,
read/write data to the 8K SRAM, and set/unset the bootloader flag.

From the vxWorks command line, the cdidemo routine can be run by
typing "cdiDemo".  The routine will exit when the user responds
to the prompt with a 'q'.

FILE: configAll.h
DESTINATION: \tornado\target\config\all\
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the global configuration file located in \tornado\target\config\all.  
It contains default definitions that apply to all targets unless redefined
in the target-specific header file config.h.


FILE: config.h
DESTINATION: \tornado\target\config\pc486\
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the target specific configuration file located in 
\tornado\target\config\pc486.  The definitions in this file
only pertain to 486 targets and will override definitions made
in the global configuration file.


FILE: makefile
DESTINATION: \tornado\target\config\pc486\
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This makefile is the entry point for 486 target board compilations.
It is located in \tornado\target\config\pc486.  The MACH_EXTRA
definition has been set to include cdidemo.o and sram.o.  Other
user defined modules may also be included here.

The entry point for the vxWorks and boot images are defined here
and may be altered to suit the users needs by redefining
RAM_LOW_ADRS and RAM_HIGH_ADRS.  Note that these definitions must
match the corresponding RAM_LOW_ADRS and RAM_HIGH_ADRS in config.h.

FILE: pc.h
DESTINATION: \tornado\target\config\pc486\
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file contains IO address and related constants for the PC386.

It ahs been altered to support six serial communication ports.

FILE: sram.c
FILE: sram.h
DESTINATION: \tornado\target\config\pc486\
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file contains the device driver routines for the 8K SRAM.

NOTE: The size of the device is (8 * 1024) or 8192 bytes.  The
      first 8 bytes are used by the drivers leaving the user
      with 8184 bytes of usable memory on the device.

The sram_read() routine copies the contents of non-volatile memory
into a non-terminated string.  The number of bytes and offset into
the SRAM are specified by the user.  A status integer is passed back
to the calling function.

The sram_write() routine copies a specified string into non-volatile
memory.  The string, number of bytes to be copied, and offset into
the SRAM are specified by the user.  A status integer is returned
to the calling function.

The enable_downloader() routine sets bit 7 at IO port 71h.  When the
board reboots, the bios routines will see the bit and run the serial
downloader instead of vxWorks.  This will allow the user to store a
new vxWorks image in Flash memory.

The disable_downloader() routine will unset bit 7 at IO port 71h so
that a vxWorks image will boot instead of the serial downloader.

FILE: sysSerial.c
DESTINATION: \tornado\target\config\pc486\
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file contains the source code to initialize the serial devices.
It has been modified to support six serial devices.

FILE: vxaddsig.cpp
FILE: vxaddsig.exe
DESTINATION: \tornado\target\config\pc486\
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a routine that adds a specific CDI defined signature to 
the vxWorks header.  The signature is 5ah a5h a5h 5ah at offset
0x18-0x1a.

*************************** IMPORTANT ***************************

After vxWorks.st is compiled, run:
  c:> \tornado\target\config\pc486\vxaddsig vxworks.st
After bootrom_uncmp.st is compiled, run:
  c:> \tornado\target\config\pc486\vxaddsig bootrom_uncmp

This will allow the bios application to recognize the vxworks
image in flash memory and subsequently load and execute it.
