      </h3>

      <p>
	These are additional FFSC commands and features that are
	enabled by setting the debugging flag 0x80000000.
	They are known collectively as &quot;Rob Mode&quot;.
      </p>

      <h4>Short Destination Syntax</h4>

      <p>
	The <b>short destination syntax</b> is a shorthand version of
	the standard syntax that is useful for people who don't like
	to type.

	Like the normal (&quot;long&quot;) destination syntax, the
	short syntax still uses <i>lists</i>, but little else.

	Keywords are omitted completely (use the abbreviated special
	characters).

	The rack and bay lists are simply separated by a forward slash
	character, which itself can be omitted if it is unambiguous
	(which is almost always the case).
      </p>

      <p>
	Thus, the following are equivalent destination specifications
	in a four-rack system with two bays per rack:
      </p>

      <table border>
	<tr>
	  <th>Long Syntax</th>
	  <th> Short Syntax</th>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><tt>rack 3 bay l</tt></td>
	  <td><tt>3/l  3l</tt></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><tt>rack 2,4 bay ul</tt></td>
	  <td><tt>2,4/ul  2,4ul</tt></td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
	  <td><tt>rack all bay all</tt></td>
	  <td><tt>*/*  **  *</tt></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><tt>bay l</tt></td>
	  <td><tt>/l</tt></td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>
	Notice that there is some potential for ambiguity between
	short-syntax addresses with no rack portion (e.g. <tt>ul</tt>)
	and ELSC or FFSC commands that coincidentally are spelled the
	same way.

	Because the FFSC does not necessarily know the entire list of
	ELSC commands, strings such as this would generally be parsed
	as bay addresses.

	Although this is not likely to become a problem in practice, it is
	possible to force an ambiguous string to be treated as a command and
	<i>not</i> a bay address
	by preceding it with a delimiter character (^X by default),
	which will delimit the end of the destination address.
      </p>
