      <h1 align="center">Notes on Building FFSC Software</h1>

      <p>
	The software for the Lego/SN0/Origin2000 Full-Featured System
	Controller runs under the VxWorks real-time operating system on
	a x86-based single board computer built by Computer Dynamics
	Inc. (CDI).

	Currently, there is no way to cross-compile VxWorks or its
	applications under IRIX, so actually building FFSC software
	images must be done on a PC using the tools provided by Wind
	River (the makers of VxWorks) and optionally their development
	environment, Tornado.

	Unfortunately, this doesn't mesh well with the standard SGI
	build environment and source control tools.

	This document describes what I have done to get Tornado and IRIX
	to coexist fairly peacefully and how to build FFSC images in
	this environment.

      <h3>The Tornado Environment</h3>

      <p>
	The initial batch of FFSC software has been built using the Wind
	River Tornado 1.0 product, which incorporates VxWorks 5.3.

	Tornado runs on a standard PC running Windows 95.
      </p>

      <p>
	The PC's that we have been using have 133MHz Pentium CPUs, 32MB
	of memory, 1-2GB of disk, an ethernet interface and one serial
	port.

	TCP/IP should be installed on Windows and the PC should be
	attached to the corporate network.

	For working with multiple FFSC's, I have found it necessary to
	add a second ethernet interface (to sit on a private network
	with the FFSC's) and at least two additional serial ports (one
	for each FFSC plus a "spare").
      </p>

      <p>
	The Tornado software should be installed according to the usual
	directions, though some directories can be removed later on,
	since they are not needed for our purposes.

	After installation, you should have a directory tree that
	includes the following:
      </p>

      <table>
	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>C:\TORNADO\HOST\X86-WIN32\BIN<tt></td>
	  <td>Build tools</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>C:\TORNADO\SHARE\SRC</tt></td>
	  <td>Certain source files needed for debugger support</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>C:\TORNADO\TARGET\CONFIG\PC486</tt></td>
	  <td>Source files for configuring VxWorks on x86 platforms</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>C:\TORNADO\TARGET\CONFIG\ALL</tt></td>
	  <td>Platform-independent source files for configuring VxWorks</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>C:\TORNADO\TARGET\H</tt></td>
	  <td>Header files for VxWorks</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>C:\TORNADO\TARGET\H\MAKE</tt></td>
	  <td>Makefiles for VxWorks</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>C:\TORNADO\TARGET\LIB\OBJI80486GNUVX</tt></td>
	  <td>VxWorks libraries for x86</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>C:\TORNADO\TARGET\SRC\CONFIG</tt></td>
	  <td>Modifiable source code for configuring VxWorks</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>C:\TORNADO\TARGET\SRC\DRV</tt></td>
	  <td>User-modifiable source code for VxWorks device drivers</td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>
	The portions of the <tt>SHARE\SRC</tt>,
	<tt>TARGET\CONFIG</tt>, <tt>TARGET\H</tt> and
	<tt>TARGET\SRC</tt> directories that are relevant to the FFSC
	are maintained in an <em>IRIX</em> source tree and can be
	deleted or renamed on the PC if desired.

	The <tt>HOST</tt> and <tt>TARGET\LIB</tt> directories are
	<em>not</em> maintained under IRIX and should be retained on
	the PC.

	I suspect that the remaining directories could be removed as
	well, but I haven't tried that yet.
      </p>

      <h3>The IRIX Environment</h3>

      <p>
	As alluded to above, all modifiable source code, including
	source code provided by Wind River (VxWorks) and CDI, are
	maintained in a standard ptools workarea under IRIX.

	The source tree lives in the "x86/ffsc" subdirectory of the
	"stand" ism of the current OS release:
      </p>

      <listing>
	/proj/ficus/isms/stand/x86/ffsc
      </listing>

      <p>
	and consists of these main subtrees:
      </p>

      <table align="center">
	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>wind</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    Wind River source code for VxWorks.

	    This consists mainly of clones of the relevant portions of
	    the <tt>C:\TORNADO\TARGET</tt> and
	    <tt>C:\TORNADO\SHARE</tt> directory trees from the Tornado
	    distribution.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>cdi</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    Source code and other files provided by CDI for the
	    FFSC hardware itself.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>sgi</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    SGI-generated source code for the FFSC.
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>
	Most of the files in these directories are in Unix, as opposed
	to DOS, format which implies that CR-LF pairs have been
	converted to single LF's and trailing EOF characters (if
	present) have been removed.

	The Tornado tools are capable of dealing with Unix format
	files, though ordinary Windows tools (e.g. notepad, edit) are
	not.

	IRIX has two tools, <tt>to_unix</tt> and <tt>to_dos</tt>, for
	converting between the two formats if necessary.

	Files that are checked into the source tree should generally
	be in unix format.

	Note that while the Tornado editor can read unix format files,
	it always writes DOS format files, so if you edit source files
	under Tornado, it will be necessary to run <tt>to_unix</tt>
	against those files before checking your changes into the
	source tree.
      </p>


      <h3>Sharing Files Between Windows and IRIX</h3>

      <p>
	If the source code lives on an IRIX system and the build tools
	are hosted under Windows/DOS, then the immediate question is
	how to get files from one platform to the other.

	There are NFS packages available for Windows 95, though
	generally for a fee.

	A cheaper solution is Samba, a freeware implementation of the
	Windows SMB protocol that allows IRIX to import and export
	Windows "shares" (i.e. directories and other resources, such
	as printers). 

	For IRIX 6.2, a working implementation of Samba can be
	installed from:

	<listing>
	  /hosts/dist/released/6.2/products/freeware-2.0/fw_samba
	</listing>

      </p>

      <h4>Setting up Samba</h4>

      <p>
	To make an IRIX directory available to Windows, add a section
	like this to the <tt>smb.conf</tt> file (in
	<tt>/usr/freeware/lib/samba</tt> with the above distribution):

	<listing>
	  [ffsc]
	  comment = FFSC workarea
	  path = /d/backup/workareas/ficus/stand/x86/ffsc
	  read only = no
	  create mode = 0644
	  writeable = yes
	  browseable = yes
	  user = rdbpw
	</listing>
      </p>

      <p>
	The path should (obviously) be changed to correspond to your
	own FFSC workarea directory.

	The user should be a user in your <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> file
	<i>that has a password</i> Windows actually matches a user
	based on their password, not their user name, so it cannot
	handle a password-less user.

	If you don't normally maintain a password on your IRIX system,
	then add a second entry to <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> with your UID
	and GID, but then set a password for it.
      </p>

      <h4>Accessing Files With Samba</h4>

      <p>
	Once you have added an appropriate section to
	<tt>smb.conf</tt> and (re)started samba on your system, you
	should be able to access the directory specified by
	<tt>path</tt> and any subdirectories as:

	<listing>
	  \\<i>hostname</i>\ffsc\<i>subdir</i>\<i>subdir</i>...
	</listing>

	from your PC. 

	For example, in the above configuration the IRIX file
	<tt>/d/backup/workareas/ficus/stand/x86/ffsc/sgi/makefile</tt>
	on host <tt>uniscan</tt> can be accessed from Windows as
	<tt>\\uniscan\ffsc\sgi\makefile</tt>.
      </p>

      <p>
	One major problem with Samba (at this time, anyway) is that it
	cannot handle mixed-case filenames: all filenames are
	converted to lower case.

	This is not normally a problem with Windows/DOS, since
	filenames are not case sensitive.

	However, this can cause trouble with makefile dependencies
	(which are case sensitive), so all #include's in source files
	should use lower-case filenames.

	The files in the <tt>.../wind</tt> and <tt>.../cdi</tt>
	directories of the source tree have already been converted
	accordingly.
      </p>

      <h4>Caching Files on the PC</h4>

      <p>
	Another problem with Samba is that it is not terribly fast, so
	compile times will tend to suffer if the source code lives
	entirely under IRIX.

	To speed things up somewhat, you may want to cache local
	copies of the <tt>.../wind</tt> and <tt>.../cdi</tt> subtrees
	on the PC, since the contents of these directories probably
	won't change very often.

	The makefiles for the FFSC software obtain the locations of
	the top-level subtrees (wind, sgi, cdi) from environment
	variables (see below) so it is possible to do this without
	having to modify any makefiles.
      </p>

      <p>
	In addition, Windows 95 provides a "briefcase" tool that can
	make it fairly easy to update these directories on the rare
	occasions that changes do occur.

	Rather than creating a directory on the PC to hold a
	cached subtree, create a new briefcase instead, then use
	Explorer to drag the contents of the IRIX directory to the
	briefcase.

	Later on, if a change is made in either directory,
	select the briefcase in Explorer and do an "Update All".
	Windows will detect what files have changed and offer to copy
	the newer file onto the older one.
      </p>

      <h3>Making FFSC Software Images</h3>

      <p>
	The VxWorks makefiles have been rewritten to cope with
	multiple source directories and to allow building different
	targets without having to clobber an older target first.

	In addition, limited-functionality IRIX makefiles are also
	provided, mainly for the sake of cleanup operations such as
	"clean" and "clobber".

	The IRIX makefiles (typically named "Makefile.sgi") are
	automatically invoked by the VxWorks makefiles when you run
	"make" under IRIX.
      </p>

      <h4>Setting MS-DOS Environment Variables</h4>

      <p>
	Both the Tornado tools and the various makefiles depend on a
	number of environment variables being set to function
	properly.

	These include:
      </p>

      <table>
	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>WIND_BASE</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    The top-level Tornado directory, typically
	    <tt>C:\TORNADO</tt>
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>WIND_UNC</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    The top-level Tornado directory in &quot;UNC&quot; format,
	    i.e. <tt>\\<i>host</i>\<i>share</i>\<i>dir</i>...</tt>.

	    For a PC named <tt>USPC</tt>, with its <tt>C:</tt> drive
	    shared with the name <tt>CDRV</tt>, this would be
	    <tt>\\USPC\CDRV\TORNADO</tt>
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>UNIX_UNC</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    The UNC path of the FFSC workarea on an IRIX workstation.

	    In the Samba configuration from above, this would be
	    <tt>\\UNISCAN\FFSC</tt>.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>VX_SRC</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    The UNC path of the <tt>wind</tt> subtree in the FFSC
	    workarea.

	    In the above example, this would be
	    <tt>\\UNISCAN\FFSC\WIND</tt>, or from a BAT file,
	    <tt>%UNIX_UNC%\WIND</tt>.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>VX_LIB</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    The UNC path of the VxWorks libraries.

	    These are usually in <tt>C:\TORNADO\TARGET\LIB</tt>, so in
	    UNC format <TT>\\USPC\CDRV\TORNADO\TARGET\LIB</TT> or simply
	    <TT>%WIND_UNC%\TARGET\LIB</TT>.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>CDI_SRC</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    The UNC path of the CDI source subtree.
	    <TT>\\UNISCAN\FFSC\CDI</TT> in this example.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>SGI_SRC</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    The UNC path of the SGI source subtree.
	    <TT>\\UNISCAN\FFSC\SGI</TT> in this example.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>BUILD_DIR</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    The UNC path of a directory in which object directories
	    and final images should be stored.

	    This would typically be the <tt>$WORKAREA</tt> directory
	    under IRIX though for performance purposes you may want to
	    cache this on the PC and copy over the top-level makefile
	    from IRIX.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>WIND_REGISTRY</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    The TCP/IP hostname of a PC running the Wind River
	    registry server.

	    Normally, this would be your PC.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    Required by the Tornado build tools.

	    This should always be
	    <tt>C:\TORNADO\HOST\X86-WIN32\LIB\GCC-LIB</tt>
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>WIND_HOST_TYPE</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    Also used by the Tornado build tools.

	    This should always be <tt>x86-win32</tt>.
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>
	A batch file that sets all of these variables can be found in
	the IRIX source tree in <tt>protoffscvars.bat</tt>.

	Copy this file to a convenient location on your PC (perhaps
	renaming it to <tt>ffscvars.bat</tt>) and edit it to match
	your configuration.

	You may want to CALL it from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file; if not,
	you will need to run it before invoking Tornado.
      </p>

      <p>
	Unfortunately, this many environment variables may cause
	Windows to generate "Out of Environment Space" errors.

	If that happens, it will be necessary to increase the size of
	your environment space by adding the option <tt>/E:1024</tt>
	to the <tt>COMMAND.COM</tt> command line.

	(&quot;Consult your owner's manual for details.&quot;)
      </p>



      <h4>Make Targets</h4>

      <p>
	From the top-level FFSC directory, the default make target is
	to build an FFSC software image of some kind.

	The exact kind of image that is built depends on the settings
	of several MAKE variables, which would typically be set on the
	command line that invokes make:
      </p>

      <table>
	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><i>no variables set</i></td>
	  <td>
	    Build a normal network-bootable VxWorks image and separate
	    symbol file.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>STANDALONE=1</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    Build a standalone VxWorks image, with the symbol table
	    built in to the image itself.

	    This is *not* a network-bootable image; it must be flashed
	    onto the FFSC.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>STANDALONE=1 NETBOOT=1</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    Build a network-bootable standalone VxWorks image.  

	    The symbol table is built into the image itself, but the
	    load address is set so that the image can be booted over
	    the network.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>PRODUCTION=1</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    Build a production version of the FFSC firmware image.

	    This is similar to a STANDALONE image, except that the
	    symbol table and other debugging features (e.g. the target
	    shell) have been removed so that the image is smaller.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>BOOTROM=1</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    Build a bootrom image.

	    Once this image is flashed into the FFSC, the FFSC will
	    try to boot the actual VxWorks image over the network.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>BOOTROM=1 FFSC_NUM=<i>num</i></tt></td>
	  <td>
	    Build a bootrom image for a specific FFSC.

	    This simply changes the naming convention for the object
	    directory and final image of the bootrom, though it can
	    also be used to tweak the bootline parameters if desired
	    (see below for info on the <tt>bootdefs</tt> file).
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>
	There are a number of specific targets that can be invoked as well:
      </p>

      <table>
	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>vxworks</tt></td>
	  <td>Same as <tt>make default</tt></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>vxworks.st</tt></td>
	  <td>Same as <tt>make STANDALONE=1</tt></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>bootrom_uncmp</tt></td>
	  <td>Same as <tt>make BOOTROM=1</tt></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>depend</tt></td>
	  <td>Generate dependencies for the selected image</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>dependall</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    Generate dependencies for all known images (i.e. all
	    6 of the images described above)
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>clean</tt></td>
	  <td>Clean up object files and generated source files</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>clobber</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    same as clean, but also deletes final targets and
	    dependency files
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>deltree</tt></td>
	  <td>delete the object directory</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>rmtarget</tt></td>
	  <td>remove the final target file(s) only</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>srcclean</tt></td>
	  <td>erase cruft (such as *~ files) from *source* directories</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td valign="top"><tt>sterile</tt></td>
	  <td>
	    like srcclean followed by a clobber and rmdir of each
	    possible object directory.
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>
	After a <tt>make sterile</tt> a <tt>p_check -w</tt> should
	only show <tt>bootdefs</tt> and <tt>ffscvars.bat</tt> (if present)
      </p>



      <h3>The bootdefs File</h3>

      <p>
	Building a bootrom image requires a fair amount of information
	about the current environment, such as the name and address of
	the host PC and the path name of the VxWorks image on the host
	machine.

	This information is obtained from a file called
	<tt>bootdefs</tt> in the top-level directory of the workarea.

	To create a bootdefs file, simply copy the template file
	<tt>protobootdefs</tt> (which is part of the source tree) to
	<tt>bootdefs</tt> and edit it to match your current
	configuration.

	If you are working with two or more FFSC's, you can examine
	the contents of the FFSC_NUM variable and adjust several of
	the values (such as the target IP address) using the GNUmake
	<tt>ifeq</tt> command.
      </p>


      <h3>Building a formal production image</h3>

      <p>
	Because the FFSC firmware is not built under IRIX, it cannot
	be formally built for releases by the build group.

	Instead, an Official Production Image is built and checked
	into the appropriate irix source tree in uuencoded form.

	The standard irix build process can then take over and
	include a binary version of the image in the standard irix
	distributions (typically in /usr/cpu/firmware/ffscfw.bin).
      </p>

      <p>
	The steps required to do all of this are split up between
	the PC and a standard ptools workarea under unix:
      </p>

      <ol>
	<li>
	  UNIX: p_tupdate everything
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  PC: update briefcases
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  PC: Roll the version number in the FFSC_VERSION #define at the
	  top of <tt>sgi/src/sgiversion.c</tt>
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  PC: <tt>make PRODUCTION=1 clobber</tt>
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  PC: <tt>make PRODUCTION=1 depend</tt>
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  PC: <tt>make PRODUCTION=1</tt>
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  Copy the resulting vxworks.st file to your unix workarea as
	  <tt>$WORKAREA/stand/x86/ffsc/vxworks.st</tt>.
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  UNIX: in $WORKAREA/stand/x86/ffsc,
	  <tt>p_modify ffscfw.bin.uu</tt>
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  UNIX (same directory): <tt>make</tt>
	  <br>
	  (this will uuencode vxworks.st into ffscfw.bin.uu, then 
	  uudecode ffscfw.bin.uu into ffscfw.bin)
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  UNIX: if you are paranoid,
	  <tt>diff&nbsp;ffscfw.bin&nbsp;vxworks.st</tt> to make sure
	  everything went OK.
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  UNIX: check-in ffscfw.bin.uu to bonnie for safe keeping
	</li>

      </ol>
