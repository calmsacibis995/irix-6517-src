	<h1>Flashing MMSC Firmware</h1>
      </a>

      <p>
	<em>
	  Note: the MMSC is also known by its older name,
	  &quot;FFSC&quot;.

	  Similarly, the MSC was also once known as the
	  &quot;ELSC&quot;.
	</em>
      </p>

      <p>
	The firmware for the Origin2000 MMSC (Multi-Module System
	Controller) resides in non-volatile storage on the MMSC
	itself.

	There are times when it is necessary to replace the existing
	firmware with a new (or at least different) firmware image.

	There are a couple of ways to accomplish this, depending
	on the circumstances of the installation and the available
	equipment.

	This document describes these different procedures and
	explains when each is necessary.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <a name="Basics">
	<h3>Basics</h3>
      </a>

      <p>
	The MMSC has six serial ports, each capable of running at speeds
	of up to 115200 Baud.

	The ports are <i>not</i> interchangable; each has a specific
	function, as follows:
      </p>

      <table>
	<tr>
	  <th>Port</th>
	  <th>Function</th>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><b>COM1</b></td>
	  <td>
	    Terminal device (the &quot;tty1&quot; port on a lego rack
	    system is actually connected to this port).
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><b>COM2</b></td>
	  <td>
	    Connection to the MSC (Module System Controller) in
	    the upper bay of the rack.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><b>COM3</b></td>
	  <td>
	    Connection to the MSC in the lower bay of the rack.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><b>COM4</b></td>
	  <td>
	    Connection to the master IO6 board.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><b>COM5</b></td>
	  <td>
	    Remote service modem (<i>not</i> a general purpose modem
	    port).

	    Also used for direct firmware downloads in emergencies.
	  </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><b>COM6</b></td>
	  <td>
	    MMSC debugging port (not used in customer systems).
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <p>
	Each serial port has a standard female 8-pin mini-din jack
	that should be labelled with its port number.

	The COM1 and COM5 ports can be attached to an Indy (etc.)
	using a normal 8-pin mini-din to 8-pin mini-din null modem
	cable.

	The COM2, COM3 and COM4 ports are attached to their respective
	hardware components with cables that should be provided with
	each system.

	They are, however, fairly standard 9-pin serial to 8-pin
	mini-din null-modem cables and in a pinch can be constructed
	by hooking together the appropriate off-the-shelf adapters
	and cables.
      </p>

      <p>
	On a multi-rack system, the COM1 and COM4 ports are typically
	used on only one rack in the system (the one with the master
	IO6).

	The COM2 and COM3 ports are generally used on every MMSC.
      </p>

      <p>
	The system console (tty1) on lego rack systems is attached to
	the IO6 <i>through</i> the MMSC.

	This allows the MMSC to intercept certain command strings, and
	also makes it possible for the MMSC to obtain data (such as
	new firmware images) from either a running unix system or the
	system console itself.
      </p>

      <p>
	The tool used to flash MMSC firmware runs under IRIX and is
	called <tt>flashmmsc</tt>.

	It ships as part of IRIX 6.4, and can also be obtained from:

	<listing>
	  homegrown.engr:/usr/dist/mmsc/flashmmsc
	</listing>

	A version that runs under IRIX 6.2 can be obtained from:

	<listing>
	  homegrown.engr:/usr/dist/mmsc/flashmmsc-6.2
	</listing>

	The MMSC firmware image typically resides in a file named
	<tt>mmscfw.bin</tt>.

	The latest version can often be found in the same directory:

	<listing>
	  homegrown.engr:/usr/dist/mmsc/mmscfw.bin
	</listing>
      </p>

      <hr>

      <a name="SerialDownloader">
	<h3>Using the Serial Downloader</h3>
      </a>

      <p>
	After certain catastrophic failures (or when an MMSC first
	arrives from the vendor) the non-volatile storage that usually
	holds the MMSC firmware is erased.

	When an MMSC is powered on in this condition, it will often
	show a blank blue screen, or perhaps some PC-style BIOS
	configuration gibberish.

	Under these circumstances, it is necessary to flash the
	firmware image into non-volatile storage using the
	&quot;Serial Downloader&quot;, a simple tool provided in the
	MMSC's BIOS.
      </p>

      <p>
	This procedure requires a direct serial connection from either
	a PC or an IRIX system to the COM5 port on the afflicted MMSC.

	The serial connection should be set up for 19200/8/N/1
	(only!).

	If using a PC, it must have a terminal emulator capable of
	performing xmodem or xmodem-1K file transfers.

	If using an IRIX system, it should have the <tt>flashmmsc</tt>
	program if possible, although an xmodem file-transfer program
	can be used if necessary.
      </p>


      <h4>Starting the Serial Downloader</h4>

      <p>
	There are two ways to start the serial downloader.

	If the MMSC has an attached display, then the serial
	downloader will be started if the bottom two buttons of the
	MMSC display (&quot;down&quot; and &quot;enter&quot;) are held
	down while the MMSC is powered up.

	This is unfortunately a fairly awkward procedure and usually
	requires two people, one to stand at the front of the system
	and hold down the bottom two buttons of the display, and the
	other to go to the back of the system and unplug (then
	reconnect) the MMSC from its power supply.

	There is actually a short delay before the buttons need to be
	pressed; if you are desparate or just gymnastically inclined,
	it may be possible to power cycle the MMSC then run around to
	the front panel in time to hold down the buttons.
      </p>

      <p>
	The display buttons should be held down until the serial
	downloader menu appears.

	It will look approximately like this:

	<listing>
	  SBC-FFSC Serial Downloader 1.0

	  (U)pload an application
	</listing>

	At this point, you can use either a terminal emulator or
	the <tt>flashmmsc</tt> program to transfer the firmware
	image.
      </p>

      <p>
	The second approach to starting the serial downloader requires
	that the MMSC already have a working firmware image.

	In this case, the MMSC command
	<a href="commands.html#DOWNLOADER"><tt>downloader enable</tt></a>
	can be used to set the &quot;serial downloader&quot; flag on
	one or more MMSCs.

	If an MMSC's &quot;serial downloader&quot; flag is set, then
	it will automatically start the serial downloader the next
	time it is reinitialized.
      </p>

      <p>
	<i>
	  Note that there is no way to reset the serial downloader
	  flag after an MMSC has been reinitialized, except by
	  flashing a new firmware image!
	</i>

	Therefore, care should be exercised when using the
	<tt>downloader enable</tt> command.
      </p>

      <p>
	If an MMSC does not have a working firmware image, then the
	only way to start its serial downloader is with the down+enter
	button technique.

	If such an MMSC does not have the display attached to it, then
	it will be necessary to unbolt it from its cabinet and move it
	next to the display so that the display can be temporarily
	attached.
      </p>


      <h4>
	Transferring the Firmware Image Using a Terminal Emulator
      </h4>
      
      <p>
	If the COM5 port of the MMSC is attached to a PC (or any other
	system capable of doing an XMODEM file transfer) you will
	flash the firmware by simply uploading it to the MMSC.

	The menu from the MMSC display should also have been echoed
	to the PC.

	If it was not, try hitting ENTER once or twice, check your
	connections/baud rate/etc. and make sure you are using a
	null modem cable (as opposed to one wired straight through)
	to connect the MMSC and PC.
      </p>

      <p>
	Once you have gotten the serial downloader menu from the MMSC,
	simply type <tt>U</tt>, then instruct your terminal emulator
	to send the firmware image file, typically
	<tt>mmscfw.bin</tt>.

	The file transfer protocol should be either XMODEM-CRC or
	XMODEM-1K.

	The transfer will take approximately 10 minutes.

	The display will show a series of dots to indicate progress;
	a typical firmware image may take 10-12 lines of dots to
	complete.
      </p>

      <h4>
	Transferring the Firmware Image Using <tt>flashmmsc</tt>
      </h4>

      <p>
	If the COM5 port of the MMSC is attached to a serial port on a
	system running IRIX, you can flash the image using the
	<tt>flashmmsc</tt> program.

	The format of the command is:

	<listing>
	  flashmmsc -d -l /dev/ttydXX -f mmscfw.bin
	</listing>

	where <tt>/dev/ttydXX</tt> is the device name of the direct
	serial port you are using, and <tt>mmscfw.bin</tt> is the name
	of the file containing the firmware image you intend to load.
      </p>

      <p>
	This program should be run once the display shows the serial
	downloader menu described above.

	It may take 10-20 seconds for the file transfer to begin,
	but once it does, a series of dots will be printed on both
	the MMSC display and the IRIX window.

	If these dots do not start after 30 seconds or so, check
	your connections as described earlier.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <a name="IrixUpgrade">
	<h3>Upgrading MMSC Firmware From IRIX</h3>
      </a>

      <p>
	If an MMSC is (more or less) operational and just needs to
	have its firmware upgraded to a new version, this can be
	accomplished from the IRIX system console using the
	<tt>flashmmsc</tt> command.
      </p>

      <p>
	The flashmmsc command is assumed to be issued from a terminal
	that has access to one of the MMSC's associated with the
	system

	(such a terminal can access the MMSC itself by first typing the
	MMSC-escape character, typically CONTROL-T).

	The flashmmsc command is first issued using the <tt>-m</tt>
	option.

	Next, the MMSC <b>flash</b> command is issued to the desired
	MMSC by first typing the MMSC-escape character then the
	appropriate flash command.
      </p>

      <p>
	For example, to flash a new firmware image onto rack 2 of a
	system that uses CONTROL-T for its MMSC-escape character, the
	sequence of events may look like this:

	<listing>
	  % flashmmsc -m

	  Ready to transfer new image to full-feature system
	  controller. To begin the transfer, type your MMSC
	  escape character (normally CTRL-T) followed by the
	  command:

	      rack &lt;rackid&gt; flash

	  where &lt;rackid&gt; is the identifier for the system
          controller you wish to upgrade.

    <i>[User types CONTROL-T]</i>

           mmsc> rack 2 flash
          Waiting for MMSC to initiate transfer...
	</listing>

	This will take the firmware image from the default location
	<tt>/usr/cpu/firmware/mmscfw.bin</tt>.

	To specify a different image location, use the <tt>-f</tt>
	option:

	<listing>
	  flashmmsc -m -f my_special_firmware.bin
	</listing>

      </p>

      <p>
	While this procedure is faster than using the serial
	downloader, it can still take 10 or more minutes to
	run, depending on the speed of the connection between
	the IO6 and the MMSC.

	As with the serial downloader,  a series of dots will be
	printed to show progress.
      </p>

      <p>
	<b>Note:</b> asynchronous messages to the console (e.g. from
	syslogd) will interfere with the file transfer.

	In environments where many messages are sent to the unix
	console, it may be helpful to run <tt>flashmmsc</tt> in
	single-user mode in order to avoid these messages.

	Alternatively, the 
	<a href="#SerialDownloader">serial downloader technique</a>
	can be used instead.

	Because this approach does not use /dev/ttyd1, it is not
	affected by console messages.
      </p>


      <h4>Increasing the speed of the MMSC/IO6 connection</h4>

      <p>
	<em>
	  NOTE: This only applies to the speed of the MMSC/IO6
	  connection that is used when downloading an image from
	  IRIX.

	  There is no way to increase the speed of the connection used
	  by the serial downloader.
	</em>
      </p>

      <p>
	The time it takes to download a new MMSC firmware image from
	IRIX can be improved by increasing the speed of the serial
	connection between the MMSC and the IO6.

	The maximum speed supported by the MMSC at this time is 57600
	baud.

	Changing the serial line speed must be done in two steps:
      </p>

      <ol>
	<li>
	  First, tell IRIX to change the speed of the IO6 serial
	  port.

	  This is generally done with the <tt>stty</tt> command.

	  For example, this would change the speed of the serial port
	  for the console on which it was entered to 57600 baud:

	  <listing>
	    stty 57600
	  </listing>
	</li>

	<li>
	  Next, tell the MMSC to change the speed of its serial port.

	  This is done with the MMSC <b>com</b> command.

	  To change the speed of the MMSC port used to talk to the IO6
	  to 57600 baud, you would first type the <i>MMSC-escape</i>
	  character (usually Control-T), then enter the command:

	  <listing>
	    rack local com 4 speed 57600
	  </listing>
	</li>

      </ol>

      <p>
	It is important to do these two commands in order.

	If you change the MMSC serial port speed first, you won't be
	able to talk to IRIX in order to have it change its serial
	port speed.

	In that case, you would need to restore the MMSC serial port
	to its original speed (usually 9600 baud) and start over.
      </p>

      <p>
	Once the speed of both serial ports has been changed, you
	should be able to issue commands to IRIX in the usual way.

	At that point, you can proceed with the <tt>flashmmsc</tt>
	command described above.
      </p>

      <p>
	Note that under normal circumstances, the serial port speed of
	the MMSC will remain unchanged after a reset or power cycle.

	However, the IRIX serial port will return to its original
	setting (usually 9600 baud) as soon as you log out.

	Therefore, it is usually wisest to change the speed of both
	serial ports back to their original settings after the
	downloading has been completed.

	This can be done as follows:
      </p>

      <listing>
	<i>from IRIX:</i>
	stty 9600

	<i>type the MMSC-escape character, then:</i>
	rack local com 4 speed 9600
      </listing>
