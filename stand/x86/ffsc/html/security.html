      <h1>
	Security on the Origin2000 Multi-Module System Controller
      </h1>

      <p>
	The Origin2000 Multi-Module System Controller (MMSC) provides
	the main system control and console interface on an
	Origin2000 system composed of two or more modules.

	Consequently, it is not unreasonable to expect that the MMSC
	should provide at least a small measure of protection against
	unauthorized access.

	This page documents the security features that are present in
	the MMSC, as well as potential security holes.
      </p>

      <h3>
	Architectural overview
      </h3>

      <p>
	First, a brief overview of the way system controllers are set
	up on multi-module Origin2000 systems.
      </p>

      <img src="mmsc-overview.gif">

      <p>
	A single module always has a Module System Controller
	(MSC) which is used for the normal system controller
	functions like reset, power, NMI, etc.

	Each MSC has a physical keyswitch which enables
	&quot;dangerous&quot; commands such as power down or reset.

	If the keyswitch is in the &quot;disable dangerous
	commands&quot; position, one can still issue dangerous
	commands over a console connection by providing a password.

	Every MSC has a password; by default, it is
	&quot;<tt>none</tt>&quot;.
      </p>

      <p>
	If a system has two or more modules, then each rack of two
	modules will have a Multi-Module System Controller (MMSC)
	attached to the two MSCs.

	In a system with two or more racks, each rack will have its
	own MMSC and the MMSC's will all be linked together over a
	<i>private</i> network.

	Exactly one MMSC in the entire complex will have an LCD
	display with six buttons.

	A user can issue commands to the MMSC(s) either from the
	display or from a terminal attached to one of the MMSCs.
      </p>

      <p>
	The purpose of the MMSC is to provide a single point of
	control for a multi-module system.

	Thus, rather than having to issue (for example) a &quot;power
	on&quot; command to each MSC, one can issue it once to the
	MMSC and the MMSC will send the command to each of the MSCs.

	To a user, the MMSC is equivalent to the &quot;sysctlr&quot;
	port on Challenge systems.

	However, an MMSC's only point of attachment to the rest of the
	system is through the MSC's - it cannot do anything to a
	particular module that the module's MSC can't do.
      </p>

      <h3>
	MMSC Authority Levels
      </h3>

      <p>
	Like the MSC, the MMSC restricts access to certain commands
	that could potentially disrupt the system.

	The available commands are determined by the
	<i>authority level</i> of the user.

	Each authority level other than <i>basic</i> may have a
	password associated with it.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the <i>basic</i> authority level, the user is allowed to
	display information and manipulate the console characteristics
	(for example, change certain control character settings), but
	commands that affect actual system operation will not be
	allowed.

	When a user with <i>basic</i> authority issues commands
	to an MSC, each command will be preceded by the MSC command
	&quot;<tt>pas</tt>&quot;, which will revoke any
	supervisor/diagnostic mode password that the MSC may have.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the <i>supervisor</i> authority level, commands that affect
	the system itself (for example, reset or power commands) are
	permitted.

	When a user with <i>supervisor</i> authority issues commands
	to an MSC, each command will be preceded by the MSC command
	&quot;<tt>pas</tt> <i>pw</i>&quot;, where <i>pw</i> is the
	MSC password.

	This will allow the user to issue restricted MSC commands even
	if the MSC's keyswitch is not currently in the diagnostic
	position.

	These commands will be followed by the MSC command
	&quot;<tt>pas</tt>&quot; to revoke the password.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the <i>service</i> authority level, commands that affect
	the operation of the MMSC itself are permitted.

	This would include commands to reconfigure the MMSC serial
	ports, and to change the various passwords.

	The <i>service</i> authority level is a superset of the
	<i>supervisor</i> authority level.
      </p>

      <p>
	There are separate authority levels associated with the main
	terminal, the alternate console, and the MMSC display.

	Thus, the display may be authorized to reset the system while
	the main terminal is not, for example.

	The <a href="commands.html#AUTHORITY"><b>authority</b></a>
	command can be used to change the current authority level
	associated with a user on a console.

	The display's authority level is changed with the
	&quot;Configure|Authority&quot; menu item.

	Each user's current authority level is retained in NVRAM and
	is restored after the MMSC has been reset.

	The default authority level for each user is <i>service</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
	There is one password associated with each authority level
	(other than <i>basic</i>) on each MMSC.

	To change to a higher authority level on a console, it is
	necessary to specify the appropriate password along with the
	<b>authority</b> command.

	No password is required to switch to a lower authority level.

	The <a href="commands.html#PASSWORD"><b>password</b></a>
	command can be used to change the current password associated
	with an authority level.
      </p>

      <p>
	Notice that no password is required to change authority levels
	on the display at this time.

	Because someone who has access to the display also has access
	to the cables and circuit breakers, this was considered to be
	a relatively low-grade risk.

	However, the ability to require a password for changing the
	display's authority level is still planned for a future
	release of the MMSC firmware.
      </p>

      <p>
	The current authority level is valid on all MMSC's in a
	system, even if the other MMSC's have different passwords for
	that authority level.

	Therefore, unless the terminal, alternate console and display
	are physically separate and secure, and attached to different
	MMSC's, there is little advantage in using different passwords
	for the same authority level on different MMSC's.
      </p>


      <h3>
	Clearing the MMSC Passwords
      </h3>

      <p>
	An MMSC's passwords, as well as its internal copies of the MSC
	passwords, are stored in NVRAM on the MMSC itself.

	If the system adminstrator puts the system into a low
	authority level and then subsequently forgets the appropriate
	passwords, the system could effectively be rendered unusable.

	Therefore, the MMSC has a procedure for clearing out its
	NVRAM in order to recover from such emergencies.
      </p>

      <p>
	Unless the system administrator is very agile, the procedure
	requires two people.

	One person must go to the back of the rack containing the MMSC
	with the display and cut the power to the MMSC (most
	conveniently by unplugging it from its power supply -- it is
	<i>not</i> necessary to cut power to the entire rack).

	The second person stands at the MMSC display and holds down
	the LEFT and RIGHT buttons.

	The first person then restores power to the MMSC.

	Once the MMSC has booted far enough to be able to read the
	display buttons, it will clear the contents of its NVRAM and
	print an appropriate message on its display.

	The MMSC then resumes booting in the normal fashion.
      </p>

      <p>
	Once the MMSC has finished booting, the passwords will have
	been cleared, and the system administrator can set them to new
	values.

	If necessary, the passwords on the other MMSC can be set as
	well.

	It will also be necessary to restore any other settings that
	may have been stored in NVRAM, such as serial port speeds,
	rack IDs, and the various MSC passwords.
      </p>
	  
      <p>
	Note that clearing an MMSC's NVRAM also clears its copies of
	the MSC passwords, thus making it incapable of issuing
	destructive commands to the MSC (assuming the MSC has a
	non-default password in the first place).

	On a carefully secured system (i.e. one on which non-default
	passwords have been set everywhere), this will render the MMSC
	effectively useless: a user would be able to reconfigure the
	MMSC, but would not be able to do issue destructive commands
	to the actual modules.

	Thus, the ability to clear an MMSC's passwords should not
	constitute an especially severe security risk.
