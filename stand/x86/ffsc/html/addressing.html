      <h1 align="center">Assigning IP Addresses to FFSC's</h1>

      <h3>Problem</h3>

      <p>
	The FFSC's in a multi-rack lego system are connected to each
	other by a private ethernet.

	VxWorks, the real time OS that runs on the FFSC, has support
	for networking, but mainly at the IP level.

	This implies that unique IP addresses need to be assigned to
	each FFSC before the FFSC's can talk to each other.

	While an SE or system administrator could in theory plug a
	console into each FFSC and assign an IP address manually, this
	is cumbersome and prone to errors.

	Furthermore, because this private ethernet isn't really an
	externally visible feature of the machine, it is likely to
	cause a fair amount of confusion and resistance.

	Therefore, the FFSC's in a lego system need to negotiate and
	assign addresses among themselves, without intervention from
	users.
      </p>

      <h3>Assumptions</h3>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  All FFSC's in a complex are connected to each other on a
	  <em>private</em> ethernet.

	  This implies that an arbitrary network address can be used.
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  The FFSC has easy access to some sort of world-unique
	  identifier, such as a MAC address, serial number, etc.
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  It is possible to send and receive raw ethernet packets
	  across an FFSC network interface before an IP address has
	  been assigned to it.
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  Messages sent across the ethernet are received
	  &quot;simultaneously&quot; by all FFSC's, within some
	  reasonable tolerance.

	  This implies no WAN repeaters, SLIP connections, or other
	  slow links in the private ethernet.
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  The FFSC has no way of determining if a display is attached
	  to it, so there is <I>no</I> trivial mechanism for
	  identifying a &quot;master&quot; FFSC.

	  It is therefore necessary to elect a master FFSC.
	</li>

      </ul>


      <h3>Proposal</h3>

      <p>
	During initialization, each FFSC will start an &quot;address
	daemon&quot; task that sends and receives several types of
	messages:
      </p>

      <dl>

	<dt>IDENTITY</dt>
	<dd>
	  Sent by an individual FFSC to describe the various
	  identifiers associated with it.

	  These identifiers include:

	  <p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      A world-unique ID (serial number/MAC address/etc.)
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      A rack ID (a small, user-friendly number to identify an
	      individual rack in the system - it's origin is TBD)
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      IP address (initially generated as a function of the
	      unique ID)
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</dd>

      <p>

	<dt>QUERY</dt>
	<dd>
	  This message is identical to an IDENTITY message, except
	  that it also asks the receiver to identify itself, typically
	  by broadcasting an IDENTITY message.
	  </dd>

      <p>

	<dt>ASSIGN</dt>
	<dd>
	  Assigns a new set of identifiers to an FFSC.

<BIG>
	  This is generally done by the &quot;master FFSC&quot; (see
	  below) when it has detected two or more FFSC's that are
	  using the same identifier.  In this case, it will
	  arbitrarily reassign addresses to avoid conflicts.
</BIG>
	</dd>

      <p>

<BIG>
	<dt>REQUEST_RACKID</dt>
	<dd>
	  This message is used when an FFSC is requesting a specific
	  rack ID, presumably to satisfy a user request.

	  It is treated the same as an IDENTITY message except that
	  the master FFSC will always resolve rack ID conflicts in
	  favor of the sender.
	</dd>
</BIG>

      </dl>

      <p>
	All of these messages are sent as raw ethernet packets with a
	fixed, non-standard protocol type, in order to distinguish
	them from normal IP packets.

	VxWorks has a mechanism for filtering incoming raw ethernet
	packets.

	When an ethernet packet with the special address negotiation
	protocol is detected, it will be sent to the address daemon
	rather than the normal networking code via a named pipe.

	(Note that VxWorks does indeed allow writing to named pipes
	from interrupt services routines.)
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>
	The general operation of the address daemon is as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>

	<li>
	  Set up initial addresses for the FFSC.

	  If the FFSC has NVRAM available to it, then the initial
	  addresses could be obtained from there.

	  Otherwise, generate addresses as follows:

	  <p>

	  <dl>

	    <dt>Unique ID</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Always taken from the MAC address of the ethernet
	      device.

	      This address is never subject to change.
	    </dd>

	  <p>

	    <dt>IP Address</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Use some fixed class-A network address for the network
	      portion, and some 24-bit value hashed from the unique ID
	      for the host portion.
	    </dd>

	  <p>

	    <dt>Rack ID</dt>
	    <dd>
	      &quot;Unassigned&quot;
	    </dd>

	  </dl>

	  <p>
	    Note that as long as no new modules are added to the
	    system, each module should end up with the same addresses
	    upon power-on that it had after successfully completing
	    address negotiation the first time it was added to the
	    system.

	    This should be helpful during debugging.

	    However, addresses are subject to change at the address
	    daemon's whim and so should not be relied upon in general.
	  </p>
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  Send out a &quot;QUERY&quot; message containing the current
	  proposed addresses.

	  Any other FFSC's should then respond with their own IDENTITY
	  messages.
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  Process any incoming &quot;FFSC Address Daemon&quot;
	  messages:

	  <p>

	  <dl>

	    <dt>IDENTITY</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Save the information in the message for future
	      reference.

	      Note that the message may supersede a previous IDENTITY
	      message for the same unique ID.

	      If an IDENTITY message is received by an address daemon
	      that contains its own unique ID, then something is
	      terribly wrong; print appropriate error messages.

	      The &quot;master FFSC&quot; (see below) may do
	      additional work.
	    </dd>

	  <p>

	    <dt>QUERY</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Same processing as for IDENTITY messages, then send out an
	      IDENTITY message for the local FFSC.

	      Set a timer for some fixed period of time; when the
	      timer goes off, examine the list of known FFSC's and do
	      the following:

	      <p>

	      <ul>
		<li>
		  If an FFSC has not responded with an IDENTITY
		  message since the last QUERY message was received,
		  remove it from the list.
		</li>

	      <p>

		<li>
		  The FFSC with the lowest unique ID in the list is
		  designated the &quot;master FFSC&quot;.
		</li>
	      </ul>

	    </dd>

	  <p>

	    <dt>ASSIGN</dt>
	    <dd>
	      If the message specifies a different unique ID than the
	      one belonging to the local FFSC, the message is ignored.

	      Otherwise, reset the identifiers associated with the
	      local FFSC to the values specified in the message.

	      If NVRAM is available, the new identifiers should be
	      stored there as well.

	      Once everything has been changed, send out an IDENTITY
	      message with the updated identifiers.
	    </dd>
	  </dl>

	</li>

      </ol>

      <hr>

      <h4>The Master FFSC</h4>

      <p>
	One FFSC in a configuration is designated the &quot;master
	FFSC&quot;.

	In addition to the usual responsibilities, the master FFSC is
	responsible for resolving conflicting identifiers.

	If it sees two IDENTITY messages that have different unique
	IDs but match on some other identifier (e.g. IP address, rack
	ID) it arbitrarily selects one of the two unique IDs and
	updates the conflicting identifier(s) as follows:
      </p>

      <dl>

	<dt>IP address</dt>
	<dd>
	  Select some other random IP address that is not currently in
	  use by another FFSC.
	</dd>

      <p>

	<dt>Rack ID</dt>
	<dd>
	  Print an appropriate error message, then reset the rack ID
	  to &quot;UNASSIGNED&quot;.

	  (The general issue of dealing with FFSC's that have
	  unassigned rack ID's is TBD.)
	</dd>

      </dl>

      <p>
	It then sends out an ASSIGN message with the updated information.
      </p>

      <p>
	The selection of a master FFSC is done shortly after a QUERY message
	has been sent by any address daemon.

	The following steps are performed on receipt of a QUERY message:
      </p>

      <ul>

	<li>
	  A timestamp is obtained, which will be used later for
	  determining stale identity table entries.
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  The address daemon sets a timer for some fairly short period
	  of time (a second or two).
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  If a QUERY or IDENTITY message is received before the timer
	  has gone off, the timer is restarted with the original
	  value.

	  As a result, the timer should not go off until no QUERY
	  <I>or</I> IDENTITY messages have been received for the
	  selected period of time.
	</li>

      <p>

	<li>
	  When the timer finally goes off, the table of identity
	  information is examined.

	  Any entries that were received prior to the timestamp that
	  was taken when the last QUERY message was encountered are
	  discarded.

	  The remaining entry with the lowest unique ID is deemed the
	  master FFSC.
	</li>

      </ul>

      <p>
	It is assumed that all FFSC's will successfully receive all
	QUERY and IDENTITY messages that are broadcast, so each FFSC
	will reach the same conclusion as to the identity of the
	master FFSC.

	It may be necessary to revisit this problem if that turns out
	to be a bad assumption.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>
	It is possible or even likely that an FFSC may not be powered
	up or initialized when other FFSC's broadcast their initial
	QUERY or IDENTITY messages, and so may miss some of them.

	Any FFSC can cause all of the other FFSC's to rebroadcast
	IDENTITY messages by simply broadcasting a QUERY message.

	This should probably be done routinely by the master FFSC once
	all of the FFSC's are likely to be powered up.

	Since the FFSC's are powered separately from the rest of the
	system, and presumably must all be powered on before the rest
	of the system can be powered on, a user &quot;system power
	up&quot; command might be a good time to do this.

	It probably wouldn't hurt for the master FFSC to send out a
	QUERY message every minute or so even during normal operation
	in order to drop any FFSC's that have been powered off or
	otherwise removed from service.
      </p>

      <p>
	A user &quot;query addresses&quot; command might be useful as
	well.

	It should cause the broadcast of a QUERY message, then wait
	until no IDENTITY messages have been received for some fixed
	period of time.

	At that point, it should be safe for it to dump out the
	contents of the local identity table.
