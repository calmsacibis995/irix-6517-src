# these are the stand libraries that have to be exported (noship!)
# so that standalone fx can be built under irix/cmd/fx.
# they go in irix_root, because we don't want yet another root
# noship product.  I hope I got this part right, as the inhouse
# root stuff is somewhat of a mystery to me, and I don't know
# if the same productname can come from too isms (the subsystem
# is unique).  Dave Olson
