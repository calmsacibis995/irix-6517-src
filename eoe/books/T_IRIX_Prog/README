007-2874-006 Topics in IRIX Programming (Susan Thomas)

The following should be incorporated into the 007 rev of the book. 
They refer to bug report #592635

1.  Section "About this Manual":
    - "Table i"
       Need  part numbers for MIPS book listed in this table.
2.  "Obtaining Manuals":
       paragraph 1 makes reference to books being installed as part of 
       IDO.  This should be changed to state books are installed as 
       part of IDF or IDL (depending on the book).

3.  corrections in Chapter 3
    - "Allocating in an Arena"
    Table 3-4 contains two entries for function name
        usrealloc(3).  I believe the second one should be  usrecalloc(3).

4.  corrections in Chapter 4:
    - "Using Semaphores"
        the information in table 4-3 and the text in the paragraph
        immediately following this table are in conflict.  The P
        operation decrements the semaphore count, and the V operation
        increments the semaphore count.  The "purpose and operation"
        in the table are incorrect.

5.  "Using Compiler Intrinsics for Test-and-Set"
        paragraph beginning with "The compiler intrinsics are different
        from the library functions, ..." incorrectly states "across s
        use of _compate_and_swap().".  I think this should be "across
        _compate_and_swap()."

6.  "System V Facilities for Mutual Exclusion"
        this title seems to be in the font/size based on the titles
        of the other sections.

7.  Table 1-3 Functions for Unlocking Memory
    The second entry in the first column mlockall(3C) should be munlockall(3C)

8.  The man page on 6.5 Beta system about shm_open(2) tells to include

9.  sys/man.h and should be changed to sys/mman.h
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the KUDZU (IRIX 6.5) edition of TOPICS IN IRIX PROGRAMMING.

=================  Work remaining to be done:

Changes for KUDZU version: accumulated maintenance, see mail folder
~cortesi/Mail/tiip-005.pending.

Need to update for KUDZU implementation of POSIX threads -- need
input from engineers (jph)

Need to update for KUDZU other changes in POSIX IPC -- info?

At request of engineering (Jeff Heller), move chapters on Asynchronous,
Direct, and Guaranteed-Rate I/O out of the React/Pro PG and put it in this
more general book, where it ties in nicely with the IPC chapters.  Need 

Update chapter 16 (in restructured book) to cover SHMEM and MPT.

=================  Work already done

Restructured book to have new (empty) chapters for I/O material from RPPG

In chapter 1, address space, I have killed the H1 section on "cache
utilization" because it was Challenge-specific, and because the new
Origin2000 Tuning book has much more detail on this topic.

In chapter 1, adding a topic on NUMA memory management, very hilevel,
mainly to point to dplace etc -- taken from my Pipeline articles.

In chapter 16, Kevin Till provided updated info on internationalization
(minor red-lines).

=================  Files in this directory:

@SETALF
	A file used by my ~/.set_workarea, please leave it in the
	checked-in material!  This file must contain a c-shell statement
	that defines the variable ALF ("all files" not "alien life form")
	as a list of all files known to PTools.  After you "source @SETALF"
	you can just enter p_modify $ALF, or p_finalize -m "" $ALF, etc.
	
README
	this file.
	
Makefile
	your standard manual makefile.

VarCondTemplate
	Template file that defines the variables and condition tags
	so you change these things with a single Book-level import.

src/*
	ASCII versions of the example programs, checked in so that
	I don't have to be responsible for them. The text of these programs
	appears in the book as various code examples, but these are the
	originals, which can be compiled, tested, etc.

TIP_.book
	The Frame book file, TIP_ is the prefix to all generated files
	for example TIP_LOF.doc.

TIP_?.tab.doc/.sgm
	The "part tab" files, one per part.

TIP_?.[1-6]*.doc/.sgm
	The chapter files, each starting with its Part number.
	For example, TIP_2a.ipcover.doc is the first chapter
	of Part II.

The "parts" in this edition have changed relative to -004.
In -004, there was no part IV, it went 1,2,3,5,6. Now a new
part 3 has been inserted and the old part 3 is part 4.

	Contents	-004 Parts	-005 Parts

	address space	TIP_1*		TIP_1* (unchanged)
				TIP_1.aspace.doc

	IPC		TIP_2*		TIP_2* (mostly unchanged)
				TIP_2a.ipcover.doc
				TIP_2b.ipcsmem.doc

				TIP_3a.flock.doc (was TIP_2f.flock)
				TIP_3b.async.doc (new AIO chapter)
				TIP_3c.fcntl.doc (new F_DIRECT chapter)

========================  History of prior releases:

FICUS and/or BONSAI releases 

POSIX Real-time update 7/96

Converted book to Part structure, a major reorganization in
which a lot of very old text, inherited almost unchanged from
AT&T SVR4 books, was restructured and rewritten.

Broke former chapter 2 "IPC" into multiple chapters each on
a separate IPC object type, forming the new
Part II "IPC" chapters 2-6.  Brought old chapter on
file locking into this Part as chapter 7 and updated with
some new material.

Broke up overweight chapter 3 "parallel computation" into
multiple chapters as Part III "Parallel Computation."

Copyedit new chapters by CC, 6/30/96.

Postscript printouts of the altered chapters shipped
with the POSIX real-time patch.

POSIX threads update 6/96

Added POSIX threads section to chapter 3.  6/96
This chapter ships as a postscript file only with the 
pthreads patch.  No production, no edit.

Banyan - IRIX 6.2 3/96

production by Lorrie in 3/96
Added new chapter 3 on "models of parallel computation"
and brought appendix on converting PVM to MPI from the
Array 2.0 document.

Converted to frame 4 and new templates 12/95
Prepared 12/95 - 1/96

6/95

Updated intl chap per lining sun.  Shipping w/ 6.1 early Banyan.

5/9/95 decided not to ship w/ 6.0.2; wait for June banyan
lorrie is prod person

12/12/94 - 

Intl - update of intl chapter to include some locale-specific

Fonts - Ivan Bach (ib) is the engineer.


9/9/94 - 

This manual contains the misc. sections from the IRIX System Programming 
Guide.  Per richa, I dropped the real-time programming chapter.

Production person is lorrie.

The list of reviewers is in ~/5.3/reviewers.
