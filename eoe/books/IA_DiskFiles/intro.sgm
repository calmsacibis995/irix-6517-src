<SECTION><TITLE>How to Use This Guide</TITLE><PARA><CITETITLE>IRIX Admin: Disks and Filesystems</CITETITLE> is written for system administrators and other knowledgeable IRIX users who need to perform administration tasks on their disks, filesystems, and logical volumes. It provides command line procedures for performing administration tasks; these tasks are most relevant to administering servers and workstations with many disks. Simple disk and filesystem administration using the graphical user interface provided by the Disk Manager is described in the <LINK BOOK="PerSysAdmin" EXTREF="96534">Personal System Administration Guide</LINK>
.</PARA>
<PARA>Anyone with a basic knowledge of IRIX can use this guide to learn and perform basic disk and filesystem administration procedures. However, some procedures in this guide can result in loss of files on the system if the procedures are not performed correctly. These procedures should be performed by people who are:</PARA>
<ITEMIZEDLIST><LISTITEM><PARA>Familiar with IRIX filesystem administration procedures</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>Experienced in disk repartitioning using <COMMAND>fx</COMMAND></PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>Experienced in performing administration tasks from the shell in the miniroot environment provided by <COMMAND>inst</COMMAND></PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>Familiar with filesystem backup concepts and procedures, particularly those using <COMMAND>dump</COMMAND></PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>
<PARA>A Caution paragraph appears at the beginning of each procedure that should be performed only by knowledgeable administrators. To learn more about system administration, see the <LINK BOOK="IA_ConfigOps" EXTREF="97829">IRIX Admin: System Configuration and Operation</LINK>
 guide.</PARA>
<PARA>To use several features described in this guide, you must obtain FLEXlm licenses by purchasing separate software options. The features that require FLEXlm licenses are:</PARA>
<ITEMIZEDLIST><LISTITEM><PARA><INDEXTERM ID="ITintro-7"><PRIMARY>FLEXlm licenses</PRIMARY>
<SECONDARY>Disk Plexing Option</SECONDARY>
</INDEXTERM>
<INDEXTERM ID="ITintro-8"><PRIMARY>plexes</PRIMARY>
<SECONDARY>Disk Plexing Option</SECONDARY>
</INDEXTERM>
The plexing feature of XLV logical volumes, which provides mirroring of disks up to four copies. This feature is provided by the Disk Plexing Option software option. </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM><PARA><INDEXTERM ID="ITintro-9"><PRIMARY>FLEXlm licenses</PRIMARY>
<SECONDARY>High Performance Guaranteed-Rate I/O</SECONDARY>
</INDEXTERM>
Guaranteed-rate I/O. Guaranteed-rate I/O (GRIO) is a feature of IRIX that enables an application to request a fixed I/O rate and, if granted, be assured of receiving that rate. By default, the system allows four guaranteed-rate I/O streams. To obtain up to 40 streams, you must purchase the High Performance Guaranteed-Rate I/O&mdash;5-40 Streams software option. An unlimited number of streams is provided by the High Performance Guaranteed-Rate I/O&mdash;Unlimited Streams software option.</PARA>
