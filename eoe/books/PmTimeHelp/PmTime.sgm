<PARAGRAPH>
The <ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS> tool
provides a graphical user interface for PCP applications requiring
time control.
<ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS> is not normally invoked directly by users, 
rather it is used indirectly by other applications - such as
<ITALICS>pmchart</ITALICS>, <ITALICS>oview</ITALICS> and
<ITALICS>pmview</ITALICS> which either launch a new <ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS>
instance or attach themselves to an existing <ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS>
instance.
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
There are two distinct dialogs used by <ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS>,
depending on whether the client applications are processing
live or archive sources of metrics.  These dialogs are described
in the <XREF IDREF="AI0020" TYPE="TITLE">Live Time Control Dialog</XREF>
and <XREF IDREF="AI0030" TYPE="TITLE">Archive Time Control Dialog</XREF>
sections respectfully.

</FIGURE></PARAGRAPH>
The Live Time Control dialog allows the user to change the update
interval, the reporting timezone, and the reported time resolution used
by the application(s) attached to this <ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS> instance.
The update interval can be changed by editing the text box labeled
<ITALICS>Interval</ITALICS>.
The change does not take effect until the enter key is pressed.
The option menu to the right of the update interval text box
allows the units of the update interval to be changed from the
default <ITALICS>Seconds</ITALICS> to other natural untis of
time such as <ITALICS>Minutes</ITALICS> or <ITALICS>Milliseconds</ITALICS>.
To change the reporting timezone, use the <ITALICS>Options/Timezone</ITALICS>
menu choice and select a new timezone from the cascading radio menu.
This will change the timezone used to display dates and times in the
<ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS> dialog and in all the applications attached
to this <ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS> instance.
The text box labeled <ITALICS>Time</ITALICS> cannot be edited,
however, you can select <ITALICS>Options/Detail/Show Milliseconds</ITALICS>
to display millisecond resolution if required, or deselect
<ITALICS>Options/Detail/Show Year</ITALICS> to suppress the year.
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
The <ITALICS>File</ITALICS> menu provides the <ITALICS>Hide</ITALICS>
option only.
It may be used to dismiss the Live Time Control dialog, however,
<ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS> will continue to run as long as at least
one PCP application is attached to it.

<TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="AI0030">Archive Time Control Dialog</TITLE>
<PARAGRAPH>
The Archive Time Control dialog is shown in Figure 2.

<GRAPHIC FILE="archive_tctl.gif" POSITION="INLINE" scale="FALSE">
<CAPTION><PREFIX>Figure 2</PREFIX>The PCP Archive Time Control dialog</CAPTION>
</FIGURE></PARAGRAPH>
The Archive Time Control dialog allows you to change the update
interval, replay speed, current archive position, reporting
timezone, and reported time resolution.
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
There are several ways to change the current archive position.

<BULLETLIST>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Drag the slider to the desired position.
This is the easiest method and allows rapid repositioning anywhere
in the archive. 
When the slider is fully to the left this corresponds to the starting
archive position, and when fully to the right this corresponds to the
finishing archive position.
These "archive time bounds" are reported in the
<XREF IDREF="AI0040" TYPE="TITLE">Archive Time Bounds</XREF>
dialog (<ITALICS>Options/Show Bounds</ITALICS>).
</PARAGRAPH></BULLET>

<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Edit the text box labeled <ITALICS>Position</ITALICS>
and press enter.
This allows you to specify an exact archive position to go to.
It is often useful to clear the text box and paste a new time using
the X11 paste buffer.
The format supported is the standard <ITALICS>ctime(3)</ITALICS> format,
so you can copy times from other PCP tools, from SYSLOG entries or whatever.
You can also enter times of the day: any <ITALICS>ctime</ITALICS> fields
that are missing will default to the start of the archive bounds.
So for example, if you specified <ITALICS>13:00</ITALICS> then the new
archive position will be the first occurrence of 1pm after the start of
the archive bounds.
If the new position is before the start (after the finish) of the archive
bounds, then <ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS> will display a warning message
and then go to the start (finish) of the archive bounds.
Refer to the <ITALICS>PCPIntro(1)</ITALICS> manual page for more
information about partial time specifications.
</PARAGRAPH></BULLET>

<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The final method of changing the current archive position
is to use the VCR controls to "play" or step forwards or backwards through
the archive in increments of the current update interval.
There are three replay modes that can be selected in the option menu
at the lower left of the dialog: <ITALICS>Normal</ITALICS>,
<ITALICS>Step</ITALICS> and <ITALICS>Fast</ITALICS>.

<BULLETLIST>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The default mode, <ITALICS>Normal</ITALICS>
will replay the archive in real-time, or at a multiple of real-time
depending on the current value of the <ITALICS>Speed</ITALICS> text box.
A <ITALICS>Speed</ITALICS> value of 1.0 corresponds to real-time.
Values less than 1.0 are proportionally slower and values greater
than 1.0 are proportionally faster.
The thumbwheel widget to the right of the <ITALICS>Speed</ITALICS>
text box allows the user to dynamically change the speed.
As a convenience, when in <ITALICS>Normal</ITALICS> mode,
double clicking on either the forward or reverse buttons has the effect
of changing directly to <ITALICS>Fast</ITALICS> mode.
</PARAGRAPH></BULLET>

<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The <ITALICS>Step</ITALICS> mode
allows fine positioning of the current archive position.
In this mode, pressing the forward (reverse) step buttons causes
the archive position to advance (reverse) by exactly one update interval.
</PARAGRAPH></BULLET>

<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The <ITALICS>Fast</ITALICS> mode
replays the archive as fast as the application allows.
The <ITALICS>Speed</ITALICS> setting has no bearing on this.
</PARAGRAPH></BULLET>

</BULLETLIST>
</PARAGRAPH></BULLET>

</BULLETLIST>
</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>
The update interval can be changed by editing the text box labeled
<ITALICS>Interval</ITALICS>.
The change does not take effect until the enter key is pressed.
The option menu to the right of the update interval text box
allows the units of the update interval to be changed from the
default <ITALICS>Seconds</ITALICS> to other natural untis of
time such as <ITALICS>Minutes</ITALICS> or <ITALICS>Milliseconds</ITALICS>.
To change the reporting timezone, use the <ITALICS>Options/Timezone</ITALICS>
menu choice and select a new timezone from the cascading radio menu.
This will change the timezone used to display dates and times in the
<ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS> dialog and in all the applications attached
to this <ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS> instance.
</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>
The text box labeled <ITALICS>Position</ITALICS> is editable.
Note that changes do not take effect until the enter key is pressed.
If the new position is within the archive bounds, then all of the
tools attached to this instance of <ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS> will
seek to the new position within the archive.  If the new position
is outside the archive bounds, then a warning dialog will be posted,
and all of the tools attached to this instance of <ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS>
will seek to either the beginning or the end of the archive
(depending which one is closer to the new position).
The slider below the <ITALICS>Position</ITALICS> text box will be
adjusted accordingly.

<PARAGRAPH>The <ITALICS>Options/Show Bounds</ITALICS> menu from the

The <ITALICS>Start</ITALICS> text box displays the start time of the archive.
The <ITALICS>Finish</ITALICS> text box displays the end time of the archive.
By default this dialog is in `automatic' mode where the text boxes
and the sliders underneath the Start and Finish text boxes are both
insensitive.
In `manual' mode (when the `Manual' box is ticked) the text boxes
and the sliders are sensitive and the user can set the start and
finish times of the archive bounds by editing the text boxes or
moving the sliders.
The archive bounds set in this dialog will by observed by the Time 
Control dialog, however, the actual archive will be left unchanged.

<ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS> uses the accelerator keys
identified by the underlined characters in the menu.
These are activated by pressing and holding the ALT key and the
appropriate key, for example, to dismiss the <ITALICS>pmtime</ITALICS>
dialog use <ITALICS>ALT+F</ITALICS> and then press <ITALICS>h</ITALICS>.
