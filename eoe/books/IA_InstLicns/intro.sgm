<INTRODUCTION><TITLE>About This Guide</TITLE><PARAGRAPH><DOCTITLE>IRIX Admin: Software Installation and Licensing</DOCTITLE> explains how to install and license software that runs under IRIX, the Silicon Graphics implementation of the UNIX operating system. The IRIX installation utility, <ITALICS>inst</ITALICS>, supports two user interfaces: Inst, a command line interface; and Software Manager, a graphical user interface. IRIX installation tools also include RoboInst, optional software that performs multiple installations on remote systems simultaneously.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>This guide contains three parts: Part I and Appendix A cover installing with Inst, the command line interface; Part II covers installing with RoboInst; and Part III covers licensing. </PARAGRAPH>
<NOTE><PREFIX>Note</PREFIX>Software Manager is documented in the <DOCTITLE></DOCTITLE>

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Using This Guide</TITLE><PARAGRAPH><DOCTITLE>IRIX Admin: Software Installation and Licensing</DOCTITLE> explains how to install Silicon Graphics software products using Inst, the command-line interface to the IRIX installation utility, <COMMAND>inst </COMMAND>(see the <REFPAGE>inst(1M)</REFPAGE> reference page). It introduces readers to Silicon Graphics software release conventions and explains how to plan, execute, and maintain a software installation on Silicon Graphics workstations and servers.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Two installation methods are described in this guide:</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH><ITALICS>live installations,</ITALICS> in which software is transferred while the target system remains in operation </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>specialized installations, called <ITALICS>miniroot installations</ITALICS>, that rely on system firmware for the software transfer (this method requires a system shutdown).</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>This guide also contains information that is specific to setting up FLEX<ITALICS>lm</ITALICS> licensing software on Silicon Graphics workstations and servers. Please refer to the following documents, which are available online from IRIS InSight, for complete information on administering a licensing scheme:</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Inst or Software Manager?</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>If you have IRIX 6.3 (or later) installed on the target system, you can use either Inst or Software Manager to perform live or miniroot installations. The tool that you choose depends on whether you prefer using a command-line or graphical interface. If unusual errors occur during a miniroot installation, the Inst interface is automatically invoked for error recovery (even if you used Software Manager to start the installation), since Inst is the only interface available from the miniroot (<XREF IDREF="30961" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;About Miniroot Installations&rdquo; in Chapter&nbsp;3</XREF> provides more information). </PARAGRAPH>
<NOTE><PREFIX>Note</PREFIX>If the target system is running IRIX 6.2 or earlier, you must use Inst to perform any miniroot installation, including an upgrade to IRIX 6.5.</NOTE>
<PARAGRAPH>The operation of <COMMAND>inst</COMMAND> and the Inst and Software Manager interfaces can be customized with a set of preferences. Use <XREF IDREF="11222" TYPE="TITLE">Chapter&nbsp;8</XREF> of this guide as a comprehensive reference for specifying preferences and for managing the configuration files that store preference settings for both interfaces.</PARAGRAPH>
