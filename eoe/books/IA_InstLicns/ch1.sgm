<PARAGRAPH>A distribution CD always includes installable release notes that provide installation instructions, including any prerequisites and incompatibilities information about the software that the CD contains.

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="34077">Software Release Types</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Any software distribution is one of several release types; the type is determined by the purpose of the software in the release. A <INDEXTARGET ID="ch18"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch18|base release --><ITALICS>base release</ITALICS> of the IRIX operating system upgrades the fundamental services that support all hardware and software functions. When a base release is installed, all components of the operating system are replaced by a new version. The new base software operates on all workstation and server models, unless the release specifically designates an older model for obsolescence.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Intermediate releases are distributed subsequent to a base release. They correct flaws in the base release or introduce additional hardware and software features to it. Because the new files in an intermediate release overwrite the existing files that they are replacing, they are also referred to as <INDEXTARGET ID="ch19"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch19|overlays --><ITALICS>overlays</ITALICS>.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>A base release and the intermediate releases that apply to it constitute a <INDEXTARGET ID="ch110"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch110|release family --><ITALICS>release family</ITALICS>. The following intermediate releases may be members of the family:</PARAGRAPH>

<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>contain a collection of one or more files that correct a serious and urgent problem in a software release, such as a threat to system security or data integrity. Patches are issued when a remedy is required before the next scheduled maintenance release. Patches are also issued to correct a problem that occurs only on a particular hardware platform.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>A patch can apply to a base release, a maintenance release, or a feature release. When you install a patch, the existing files are moved to a holding directory and the new files are installed in their place.</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
</HANGLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>Only maintenance releases or feature releases are installed onto a particular base release. For example, if you choose to install a maintenance release on the IRIX 6.5 base release, all subsequent installations will be maintenance releases (or patches to a maintenance release) until you install the next base release.</PARAGRAPH>

A small number of products support critical functions and must be installed if the system is to operate; other products are not critical but optimize system operation and are recommended for installation by the manufacturer. A subset of required and recommended products is installed in servers and workstations before they leave the factory.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch115"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch115|product: <ITALICS>See</ITALICS> software products. --></PARAGRAPH>

When you install a product, files from the previous version are automatically removed before the new files are installed (see <XREF IDREF="72830" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Managing Configuration Files&rdquo;</XREF> for exceptions).

<PARAGRAPH>The name of an image is the product shortname followed by an extension that describes the image's function. For example, <INDEXTARGET ID="ch126"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch126|images: naming convention --><ITALICS>ftn_dev.sw</ITALICS> is the image in the Fortran 77 Compiler product that contains files for program execution, and <ITALICS>ftn_dev.man</ITALICS> is the image that contains documentation files.</PARAGRAPH>
