<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Step 1: Invoking Inst</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>For miniroot installations, which are required whenever you install software that is fundamental to the IRIX operating system, Inst is automatically started when the miniroot is loaded (see <XREF IDREF="47365" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Starting a Miniroot Installation&rdquo;</XREF>). For live installations, Inst is started from the command line of an IRIX shell (see <XREF IDREF="72525" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Starting a Live Installation&rdquo;</XREF>). After Inst is started, it displays the default distribution source and the Main menu, as shown in <INDEXTARGET ID="ch44"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch44|Main menu (illustration) --><XREF IDREF="39297" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;4-2</XREF>.</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="24071">Step 2: Specifying the Source</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Specifying a distribution source is not always necessary during an installation procedure, for frequently the default distribution is appropriate. By default, Inst uses the distribution that was previously specified as the source of installable software for a live installation. For miniroot installations, Inst expects to use the distribution from which you loaded the miniroot. The default source is posted in a message above the Main menu when Inst is started (see the final step in <INDEXTARGET ID="ch45"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch45|distribution source: specifying --><XREF IDREF="40576" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Loading From a Local CD&rdquo;</XREF> or <XREF IDREF="20885" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Loading From a Remote Distribution Source&rdquo; in Chapter&nbsp;3</XREF>).</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If the default source is not appropriate, however, use the <COMMAND>from</COMMAND> command to replace the current distribution source; use the <COMMAND>open</COMMAND> command to specify additional sources of installable software. The <COMMAND>close</COMMAND> command closes any distribution that you specified with either the <COMMAND>from</COMMAND> or the <COMMAND>open </COMMAND>command. You can use the <COMMAND>from, open</COMMAND>, and <COMMAND>close </COMMAND>commands as many times as necessary during an installation session.</PARAGRAPH>
<NOTE><PREFIX>Note</PREFIX>When Inst posts multiple distributions in <COMMAND>from</COMMAND>, <COMMAND>open</COMMAND>, and <COMMAND>close</COMMAND> listings, it numbers each item in the list. You can use this number as a command argument instead of typing the entire distribution pathname. For example, <COMMAND>close</COMMAND>&space;<VARIABLE>2</VARIABLE>&space;<VARIABLE>4</VARIABLE>&space;<VARIABLE>7</VARIABLE> closes the three distribution sources numbered 2, 4, and 7 in the distribution list.</NOTE>

<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>A missing software distribution<INDEXTARGET ID="ch469"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch469|error: distribution --></PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
ERROR : The distribution <VARIABLE>server</VARIABLE>:<VARIABLE>pathname</VARIABLE> does not exist
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>This failure occurs if the distribution source that was saved in the checkpoint restart file no longer is exists or is unavailable. For example, the distribution source may be unaccessible because of a network failure or because the distribution was moved. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If the distribution is missing and you select item 1, the error message is posted as soon as you make your selection. If the distribution is missing and you select item 2, the error message is posted when you try to list the distribution.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Different software distribution</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
ERROR : Invalid product sc.sw.sc in selections file
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>This failure occurs if the location of the distribution source in the checkpoint restart file is the same but the products in the distribution are different. For example, you see this error if a CD other than the correct distribution CD is loaded in the CD-ROM drive or if the contents of the distribution directory were changed since the previous session. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If the software distribution is different from the previous installation and you select item 1, the error message is posted as soon as you make your selection. If the software distribution is different from the previous installation and you select item 2, the message is posted when you try to list the distribution.</PARAGRAPH>

<EXAMPLE>
ERROR : Could not retry previous installation because of errors in the selections. Conflicts must be resolved.
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>This failure occurs when the installed software on the target or the product dependencies on the distribution has changed since the previous installation. The changes result in conflicts that prevent installation. If there are bad selections and you select item 1 to restart the installation, the installation is stopped and you see the error message.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>After the message, you see the standard conflicts screen. If there are bad selections and you choose item 2 to restart the installation, you see only the conflicts screen.

</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Not enough disk space</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>This failure occurs when the software that was selected for the previous installation requires more disk space than is available on the target. If there is not enough disk space and you select item 1 to restart the installation, you see this message:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
ERROR : Could not retry previous installation because of errors in the selections. Installation requires too much space.

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="72830">Managing Configuration Files</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Sometimes a distribution contains configuration files, which are either required or recommended for operation, that exist on the target in a modified form (an <INDEXTARGET ID="ch471"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch471|configuration files: managing --><FILENAME>/etc/rpc</FILENAME> file, for example). When the target system contains modified configuration files, Inst preserves the modified files during the installation in one of two ways: </PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>If the new configuration file is required for operation, Inst copies the existing target version to a file of the same name, appending a <INDEXTARGET ID="ch472"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch472|configuration files: creating <ITALICS>.O</ITALICS> versions --><FILENAME>.O</FILENAME> (obsolete) extension to it (<FILENAME>/etc/rpc.O</FILENAME>, for example). Then it installs the new, required version of the file by its standard name (<FILENAME>/etc/rpc</FILENAME>). </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>If the new configuration file is recommended (but not required), Inst leaves the existing file on the target untouched; it writes the recommended version to a file of the same name, appending a <INDEXTARGET ID="ch473"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch473|configuration files: creating <ITALICS>.N</ITALICS> versions --><FILENAME>.N</FILENAME> (new) extension to it. You can use<FILENAME>&space;.N</FILENAME> files at your discretion.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>For example, assume that the target contains a modified <FILENAME>/etc/fstab</FILENAME> file before an installation and the distribution contains a new, recommended <FILENAME>/etc/fstab</FILENAME>. After the installation, the original target version is still in <FILENAME>/etc/fstab</FILENAME>; the new version is contained in <FILENAME>/etc/fstab.N</FILENAME>. </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Configuration File Anomalies</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>In most cases, Inst handles modified configuration files with predictable results: after installation, the target contains an installed version and an alternate version of the file. Normally, relevant portions of the alternate versions are subsequently merged into the installed version and the alternate version is removed. However, if you repeat an installation of the same software, the results may be different.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>For example, it is possible to create both a <FILENAME>.O</FILENAME> and a <FILENAME>.N</FILENAME> version of the same configuration file. This happens when Inst creates a <FILENAME>.O</FILENAME> version of the file and you modify the newly installed version instead of merging and removing the <FILENAME>.O</FILENAME> version. During the repeat installation, Inst compares the installed file with the version on the distribution; when it finds that the two are different, it creates a copy of the distribution version, assigning it a <FILENAME>.N</FILENAME> extension.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>As another example, assume that the <FILENAME>.N</FILENAME> version of a configuration file is merged with the installed version and erased. During the repeat installation, Inst detects differences between the installed file and the distribution version, so it creates a copy of the distribution version, assigning it a <FILENAME>.N</FILENAME> extension.</PARAGRAPH>
