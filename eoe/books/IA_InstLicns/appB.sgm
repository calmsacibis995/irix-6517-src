<APPENDIX LBL="2"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="38944">Troubleshooting Installations</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>This appendix presents information and procedures that you can use to troubleshoot problems that you might encounter during installation.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The appendix begins with a description of the types of error messages that Inst produces and then describes how to set Inst preferences to control the amount of feedback Inst provides. Most of the rest of the appendix discusses specific errors, arranged in groups according to how and when they are generated. Information and instructions are provided to help correct the error condition. A section at the end describes how to contact technical support and what information to have ready.</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Network Problem Diagnosis During an Inst Session</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>If the network is slow (usually indicating network problems), Inst may appear to be frozen for long periods (much greater than the time-out time); in reality it may be reading a few bytes at a time, timing out, retrying, then reading a few more bytes. This sort of behavior, as well as any error messages regarding network time-outs or retries, is an indication that it may be desirable to investigate the condition of the network.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Here are some of the common error messages that might occur during a remote installation session:</PARAGRAPH>
<ERRORMSG><MSG>-- Host `<ITALICS>host</ITALICS>' is not responding, retrying
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>The remote host did not respond in a reasonable amount of time; we will retry a few times before giving up. See the preference &ldquo;network_retry&rdquo; for a discussion of how to control the number of retries Inst makes before it gives up.</PARAGRAPH>
</EXPLANATION>
</ERRORMSG>
<ERRORMSG><MSG>-- Timed-out waiting for `<ITALICS>host</ITALICS>'
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>The remote host has timed out several times in a row. A serious network problem probably needs to be resolved before we can continue. Either resolve the network problem and continue the installation or cancel the install and try again later.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>On a slow network, changing the network time-out (by setting the preference &ldquo;timeout&rdquo; to the new time-out in seconds) may be necessary, though in general this is not recommended and will probably not cure a real network problem but will only increase the length of time before such a problem is reported to the user.</PARAGRAPH>
</EXPLANATION>
</ERRORMSG>
<ERRORMSG><MSG>-- Can't set up network connection to host <ITALICS>host</ITALICS>: <ITALICS>reason</ITALICS>
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>You were unable to establish an initial network connection to the remote host for the reason given. See <XREF IDREF="96033" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Checking Network Connections&rdquo;</XREF> for a discussion of what to do to test the network.</PARAGRAPH>
</EXPLANATION>
</ERRORMSG>
<ERRORMSG><MSG>-- Lost connection to <ITALICS>host</ITALICS>
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>The network connection was broken. This probably means that the remote host is down.</PARAGRAPH>
</EXPLANATION>
</ERRORMSG>
<ERRORMSG><MSG>-- No such host: <ITALICS>host</ITALICS>
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>The host is not listed in the host table. This could mean that the hostname was mistyped, that there is something wrong with the <FILENAME>/etc/hosts</FILENAME> file, or that the NIS or DNS server is down.</PARAGRAPH>
</EXPLANATION>
</ERRORMSG>
<ERRORMSG><MSG>-- Couldn't parse ls output from remote host: `<ITALICS>ls_output</ITALICS>'
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>Running an <COMMAND>ls</COMMAND> command on the installation server succeeded but gave output different from what was expected. The only immediate solution is to install a different <COMMAND>ls</COMMAND> program (for example, a POSIX compatible <COMMAND>ls</COMMAND> program) on the installation server.</PARAGRAPH>
</EXPLANATION>
</ERRORMSG>
<ERRORMSG><MSG>-- Failed reading remote directory <ITALICS>dir: error_msg</ITALICS>
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>It was not possible to perform an <COMMAND>ls</COMMAND> command on the installation server. The given error string should give some clue as to the likely reasons:</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLISTIND><BULLETIND><PARAGRAPH>Illegal option: The installation server has an <COMMAND>ls</COMMAND> command that takes a different set of arguments from the ones the local <COMMAND>ls</COMMAND> command takes. The only immediate solution is to install a different <COMMAND>ls</COMMAND> program (for example, a POSIX-compatible <COMMAND>ls</COMMAND> program) on the installation server.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLETIND>
<BULLETIND><PARAGRAPH>Cannot access ... No such file or directory: The remote directory does not exist</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLETIND>
<BULLETIND><PARAGRAPH>Cannot access ... Permission denied: The given user does not have sufficient permissions to access the directory.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLETIND>
</BULLETLISTIND>
</EXPLANATION>
</ERRORMSG>
<ERRORMSG><MSG>-- Can't get shell/tcp network port to host <ITALICS>host</ITALICS>: <ITALICS>error_msg</ITALICS>&space;
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>The service &ldquo;exec&rdquo; or &ldquo;shell&rdquo; was not found on the system. This probably means that there is something wrong with the file <FILENAME>/etc/services</FILENAME> or the services map on the NIS server.</PARAGRAPH>
</EXPLANATION>

</SECTION3>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="40583">Network Problem Diagnosis During Miniroot Installations</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>These messages come from the boot PROM rather than Inst.</PARAGRAPH>
<ERRORMSG><MSG>-- unable to load bootp()machine:/path/sa(sash.IPXX)
-- bootp()machine:/path/sa(sash.IPXX) is not a valid file to boot
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>To find out if the file exists, enter the following command on the installation server:</PARAGRAPH>
<CODE>

<PARAGRAPH>Chances are that the file does exist and that this is probably a network problem&mdash;trying to <COMMAND>bootp</COMMAND> through too many gateways. Because the <COMMAND>bootp</COMMAND> protocol is not as robust as it could be, it is sometimes unable to find a file on a server if network traffic is heavy. By installing from an NFS-mounted file system on a local network, NFS is dealing with the gateways and <FILENAME>bootp</FILENAME> is only going across the local network.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>This can also occur when the server is a multihomed machine.</PARAGRAPH>
</EXPLANATION>
</ERRORMSG>
<ERRORMSG><MSG>-- no server for machine:/path/sa(sash.IPXX)
</MSG>
</ERRORMSG>
<ERRORMSG><MSG>-- unable to load bootp()machine:/path/sa(sash.IPXX): file not found

</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>The previous message might appear when loading from an automounted distribution (for example, <FILENAME>machine:/hosts/</FILENAME>...).</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>These errors indicate that you need to modify <FILENAME>/etc/inetd.conf </FILENAME>(<FILENAME>/usr/etc/inetd.conf</FILENAME> on pre-5.<VARIABLE>x</VARIABLE> systems) on the installation server (<ITALICS>mach1</ITALICS> in this example) and remove the &ldquo;-s /usr/local/boot /usr/etc/boot&rdquo; from the <FILENAME>tftpd</FILENAME> entry (or alternatively, add the desired pathname to the end of the list of accessible paths after <ITALICS>-s</ITALICS>).

</EXPLANATION>
</ERRORMSG>
<ERRORMSG><MSG>-- No remote connection
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>This is probably an internal error resulting from trying to access a remote connection that used to be open but is now closed.</PARAGRAPH>
</EXPLANATION>
</ERRORMSG>
<ERRORMSG><MSG>-- Unable to locate your password information (user-id UID)
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>Your current user ID is not a valid account on the system. This unlikely error probably means there is something wrong with the host table (<FILENAME>/etc/hosts</FILENAME>) or with the NIS server.</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>These examples show the CD-ROM drive on an older workstation. The CD-ROM drive is recognized, but it is shown as a disk. If you do not see a line of output for a CD-ROM drive, it is not recognized.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>When a CD-ROM drive is not recognized, it is usually because the CD-ROM drive was not powered up properly. If it is an external drive, the CD-ROM drive must be powered on before the workstation main unit is powered on.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The procedure for making the system recognize the CD-ROM drive depends on whether you are running IRIX or the miniroot:</PARAGRAPH>
<ORDEREDLIST><LIST><PARAGRAPH>If you are running IRIX, exit Inst if it is running, warn other users, shut the workstation down with <COMMAND>shutdown </COMMAND>(see the <REFPAGE>shutdown(1M)</REFPAGE> reference page), or use System Shutdown on the System menu, then reboot the workstation to bring up IRIX again.</PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>If you are in the miniroot, get back to the PROM Monitor, press the <BUTTON>Reset</BUTTON> button on the workstation main unit and then bring up Inst again. If this does not fix the problem, turn the CD-ROM drive off and then on again.</PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
</ORDEREDLIST>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Verifying That a CD Is Mounted</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>When using a CD-ROM drive, the CD that contains the software you want to install must be mounted. Mounting is done automatically by Inst when using a local CD-ROM. The user executing Inst must have root privileges in order for it to be able to mount the CD. When using a remote CD-ROM, the mounting must be done separately on the remote server. To verify that the CD is mounted, use the <COMMAND>df </COMMAND>command, below (see the <REFPAGE>df(1)</REFPAGE> reference page). If you are using a local CD-ROM, escape to a shell. If you are using a remote CD-ROM, enter the command on the installation server.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>For example,</PARAGRAPH>
<CODE>
% <USERINPUT>/bin/df</USERINPUT>&space;

</CODE>
<PARAGRAPH>Look at the directory name on the right. For a local CD-ROM, you should see <FILENAME>/CDROM</FILENAME>. For a remote CD-ROM, the name <FILENAME>/CDROM</FILENAME> is likely but another directory name for the mount point (called <ITALICS>CDdir</ITALICS> in this document) may have been chosen.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If the CD is mounted, list the files it contains to verify that you have the correct CD inserted. </PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="87605">Checking Distribution Directories and CDs</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>To verify that a distribution directory or a mounted CD contains the right files, the workstation that contains the distribution must be running IRIX. Change directories to the distribution directory (<FILENAME>distdir</FILENAME> or<FILENAME>&space;CDdir/dist</FILENAME>) and list the files with <FILENAME>ls</FILENAME>.

<CODE>

<ITALICS>product</ITALICS>.idb
<ITALICS>product</ITALICS>.<ITALICS>images</ITALICS>&space;
</CODE>
<PARAGRAPH>The file <FILENAME>sa</FILENAME> is used for miniroot installations only, so it does not need to be present if you are doing an IRIX installation. The file <FILENAME>mr</FILENAME> may or may not be present; there is no problem if it is missing. More than one product file, <FILENAME>product</FILENAME>, may be in the directory. Each product requires a file called <FILENAME>product</FILENAME>.idb (installation database) and one or more <ITALICS>product</ITALICS>.<ITALICS>image</ITALICS> files. Examples of product files are <FILENAME>eoe</FILENAME> and <FILENAME>maint_nfs</FILENAME>. Common values of <ITALICS>images</ITALICS> are <FILENAME>man</FILENAME> and <FILENAME>sw</FILENAME>.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If a distribution does not have the correct files, the most likely causes are that the distribution directory was not copied correctly or that the files in the distribution directory were modified after it was created. Use <COMMAND>distcp -c </COMMAND>to compare the original with the copy (see the <REFPAGE>distcp(1M)</REFPAGE> reference page) and, if there is a discrepancy, copy the original distribution again.</PARAGRAPH>
