<CHAPTER LBL="3"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="13471">Starting an Installation</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>One of two procedures is used to invoke Inst for an installation session, depending on whether you plan a miniroot installation or a live installation. This chapter explains how to determine what type of installation is required and provides instructions for invoking Inst for each installation method.

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="30961">About Miniroot Installations</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>For installations where fundamental IRIX services, such as filesystem management, are either unavailable or unreliable, a special installation method is required. This method, known as a <COMMAND>miniroot installation</COMMAND>, relies on services in the target's programmable read-only memory (PROM) to transfer special installation tools (see <XREF IDREF="16175" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;1-1</XREF> on <XREF IDREF="16175" TYPE="TEXT">page&nbsp;6</XREF>) from the distribution source to the target. This transfer is referred to as <ITALICS>loading the miniroot</ITALICS>. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Loading the miniroot is a two-phase process: first the <INDEXTARGET ID="ch32"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch32|<ITALICS>sash</ITALICS> program --><ITALICS>sash</ITALICS>, or standalone shell, is transferred from the source to the target system for execution; then, the <FILENAME>sash</FILENAME> fetches the miniroot from the source and copies it to the swap partition of the disk. The <FILENAME>sash</FILENAME> and miniroot are frequently loaded from a locally-mounted CD, but they can also be loaded from a network location using the Internet Bootstrap Protocol (<COMMAND>bootp)</COMMAND>. A network host containing the <FILENAME>sash</FILENAME> and miniroot for various workstation and server architectures is referred to as a <INDEXTARGET ID="ch33"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch33|boot server --><ITALICS>boot server</ITALICS>.</PARAGRAPH>
<CAUTION><PREFIX>Caution</PREFIX>The miniroot is copied from the distribution source to partition 1 of your system disk, which is normally the swap partition. If you have customized your system in such a way that partition 1 contains valid data, be sure to back up the data in partition&nbsp;1 before the miniroot installation to avoid losing it.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch34"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch34|disk partitions --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch35"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch35|swap partition, in miniroot installations --></CAUTION>
<PARAGRAPH>By default, the miniroot restricts the target to installation operations and the target operates like an ASCII terminal, even on graphics systems. These restrictions preserve the integrity of the operating system while it is being updated.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Two methods are available for performing miniroot installations. The first method is used when only one target system is involved and the installer uses the target system directly. Instructions for using this method are given in <XREF IDREF="47365" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Starting a Miniroot Installation&rdquo;</XREF>. The second method installs any number of target systems from any network location.</PARAGRAPH>
