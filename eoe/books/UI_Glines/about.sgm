<INTRODUCTION><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="30361">About This Guide</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>This guide is written for developers of software products used on Silicon Graphics workstations, including software engineers, graphical user interface designers, usability specialists, and others involved in the design process. It contains guidelines to help you design products that are consistent with other applications and that integrate seamlessly into the IRIX Interactive Desktop. The result of this consistency and integration is that your products work the way end users expect them to work; consequently, end users find your products easier to learn and use. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Using this guide, you learn how to design user interfaces for Silicon Graphics applications. There are also specific examples of what is and isn't appropriate and why. Note that the guidelines discussed in this guide are just that&mdash;guidelines, not rules; they're designed to apply to the majority of applications, but there will certainly be anomalous applications for which these guidelines don't make sense.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Developers using this guide are expected to be programming with the IRIS IM user interface toolkit. IRIS IM is the Silicon Graphics port of the industry-standard OSF/Motif user interface toolkit for use on Silicon Graphics computers. The IRIX Interactive Desktop guidelines encourage compliance with the OSF/Motif guidelines described in <DOCTITLE>OSF/Motif Style Guide, Release 1.2</DOCTITLE>, so you should be familiar with the OSF/Motif manual before reading this one. In addition, the IRIX Interactive Desktop guidelines clarify and elaborate on many OSF/Motif style issues; they recommend many value-added extensions and improvements to the OSF/Motif style that don't conflict with the basic OSF/Motif interface. Following the recommendations in this guide will help ensure that your software product provides all of the functionality and ease of use designed into the IRIX Interactive Desktop.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>One focus of this guide is how your application should look and feel on the IRIX Interactive Desktop when you're finished creating it&mdash;that is, how users will expect to be able to interact with your application. The implementation details of how to achieve this look and feel are covered in the <DOCTITLE>OSF/Motif Programmer's Guide</DOCTITLE> and the <DOCTITLE>IRIX Interactive Desktop Integration Guide</DOCTITLE>. </PARAGRAPH>
