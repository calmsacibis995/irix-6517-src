<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="74719">Providing Graphic Feedback</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Appropriate desktop icons for your application's executable and data files allow users to readily identify your application, files that were created using your application, and the current state of the application (that is, running or not running). Design executable and data file icons to provide this sort of graphic feedback, as discussed in <INDEXTARGET ID="ch11.feedback3"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch11.feedback3|user feedback:graphicgraphic feedback --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch11.feedback4"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch11.feedback4|Desktop iconsDesktop icons:statesstates:Desktop icons --><XREF IDREF="94988" TYPE="TITLE">Chapter&nbsp;2, &ldquo;Icons.&rdquo;</XREF></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The IRIX Interactive Desktop look includes graphic modifications that were made to standard IRIS IM in order to improve the level of user feedback. For instance, locate highlight visually indicates which components are live functional objects and which are passive graphics. In addition, scrollbars were redesigned to keep track of their initial positions, and radio buttons and checkboxes show their state more emphatically. Your application should use the IRIX Interactive Desktop look, which is discussed in <INDEXTARGET ID="ch11.feedback5"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch11.feedback5|locate highlightscrollbars:Indigo Magic lookradio buttons:Indigo Magic lookcheckboxes:Indigo Magic look --><XREF IDREF="17675" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;The IRIX Interactive Desktop Look: Graphic Features and Schemes&rdquo; in Chapter&nbsp;3</XREF>.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Users expect the pointer to change shape to reflect the current state of the window&mdash;for example, when the application is busy processing and can't accept keyboard or mouse input, the pointer changes to a watch. Guidelines for pointer shapes are discussed later in this chapter, in <INDEXTARGET ID="ch11.feedback6"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch11.feedback6|pointer:shapes, state andstates:pointers, shapes and --><XREF IDREF="15568" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Pointer Shapes and Colors.&rdquo;</XREF></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>As users select data in a window, highlight that data to show what's included in the current selection. The data should remain highlighted even when the window isn't the currently active window. See <INDEXTARGET ID="ch11.feedback7"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch11.feedback7|data exchange:highlighting selected datahighlighting selected data --><XREF IDREF="93501" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Highlighting a Selection&rdquo; in Chapter&nbsp;7</XREF> for more information about highlighting selections.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="14245">Keeping Information Up to Date</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>As users set particular values in components such as radio buttons, check boxes, lists, and option menus, your application should always indicate the current values so that the user knows what they are. For example, the Language control panel highlights the current values for &ldquo;Locations&rdquo; and &ldquo;Keyboards&rdquo; in the two corresponding lists. Radio buttons, checkboxes, lists, and option menus are discussed in more detail in <INDEXTARGET ID="ch11.feedback8"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch11.feedback8|user feedback:updating displaysdisplays, updatingupdating displays --><XREF IDREF="95140" TYPE="TITLE">Chapter&nbsp;9, &ldquo;Controls.&rdquo;</XREF>&space;</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Even if users can change values or data without using an explicitly provided component, your application should still endeavor to display the current information. For instance, users can change the file hierarchy using the shell; if your application displays information affected by such a change (such as a directory view), the display should update dynamically as the user makes the change. If it's impossible or if it would have a significantly adverse effect on your application's performance to make the display dynamic, choose a design that looks static. For example, you might use label text, which looks like it's a permanent part of the background, rather than text fields, which look like they should be updated constantly. The desktop uses this strategy for the &ldquo;business cards&rdquo; that are displayed when a user double-clicks a person icon.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>When component settings apply to a specific object, the displayed components should reflect the values for the currently selected object (if there is one). For example, if you select some text in an IRIS Showcase file, the &ldquo;Font Family,&rdquo; &ldquo;Font Size,&rdquo; Bold/Italic/Underline, and color options in the Master Gizmo are updated to display the characteristics of the selected text. </PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="21977">Providing Messages to the User</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>In addition to providing immediate graphic feedback through your application's icons, components, and pointers, provide textual messages that describe your application's status. Keep in mind that by default the window manager for the IRIX Interactive Desktop, <INDEXTARGET ID="ch11.feedback9"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch11.feedback9|user feedback:messagesmessages, useruser messages --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch11.feedback10"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch11.feedback10|<VARIABLE>stdout</VARIABLE><VARIABLE>stderr</VARIABLE> --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch11.feedback11"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch11.feedback11|Desktop control panel:<VARIABLE>stderr</VARIABLE> messagescontrol panels:Desktop --><FILENAME>4Dwm</FILENAME>, sends <FILENAME>stdout</FILENAME> and <FILENAME>stderr</FILENAME> messages to the Console window, which users typically keep minimized. (Users can choose to have <FILENAME>stderr</FILENAME> messages appear in a dialog box by using the Desktop Settings control panel available from the Desktop->Customize cascading menu in the Toolchest, and they can of course un-minimize the Console window.) Because of these default settings, you can't be sure that users will notice messages sent to <FILENAME>stdout</FILENAME> and <FILENAME>stderr</FILENAME>; therefore, use dialogs or status areas in your application instead. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>In particular, use dialogs to provide warning messages, error messages, and work-in-progress feedback, as discussed in <INDEXTARGET ID="ch11.feedback12"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch11.feedback12|dialogs:user feedback --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch11.feedback13"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch11.feedback13|status areas --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch11.feedback14"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch11.feedback14|minimized windows:labelslabels:minimized windows --><XREF IDREF="30192" TYPE="TITLE">Chapter&nbsp;10, &ldquo;Dialogs.&rdquo;</XREF> Also define an area on primary windows for status messages in the cases discussed in <XREF IDREF="30855" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Status Areas in Primary Windows&rdquo; in Chapter&nbsp;6</XREF>. Finally, change the label (or possibly the image) of your application's minimized window when appropriate to provide feedback; <XREF IDREF="87201" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Minimized Windows&rdquo; in Chapter&nbsp;3</XREF> discusses when to use this technique. </PARAGRAPH>

In these cases, the pointer shape can be used to indicate the current mode. For example, a paint program typically has different tools or modes that the user can select; the pointer shape might resemble a specific brush style, spray paint can, eraser, or I-beam pointer, depending on the tool selected. When you design new pointer shapes, follow the guidelines listed in the reference page on Pointer Shapes in the <INDEXTARGET ID="ch11.feedback26"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch11.feedback26|pointer:designing --><DOCTITLE>OSF/Motif Style Guide</DOCTITLE>: create a pointer shape that gives a hint about its purpose and is easy to see, avoid shapes that create visual clutter, and make its hotspot easy to locate.
