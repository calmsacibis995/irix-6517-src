<PARAGRAPH>Your application's desktop icons can appear in any of several places on the IRIX Interactive Desktop, along with icons from other applications. For example, your icons can appear on the desktop background, in Directory View windows, and in the Icon Catalog. <INDEXTARGET ID="ch02.icons5"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch02.icons5|Desktop icons:designing appearanceDesktop icons:appearance --><XREF IDREF="68489" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;2-1</XREF> shows the Icon Catalog, which displays several application icons representing executable files. <XREF IDREF="68653" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;2-2</XREF> shows various data file icons that can appear on a user's desktop. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>For each application, you'll need to create an application icon. If your application saves its data in a unique format, you'll also need to create a data file icon. (If your application saves its data in a standard data format, your application's data files will automatically appear on the desktop using the appropriate standard data icon.)<INDEXTARGET ID="ch02.icons6"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch02.icons6|Desktop icons:data icons --></PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>To make your application and file icons stand out in a group of icons, be sure to create meaningful symbols that are distinctive and represent your product.

<PARAGRAPH>You need to create the symbols for your application icon and for any unique file types your application creates. Create the symbols with the IconSmith drawing tool, which is described in Chapter&nbsp;12, &ldquo;Using IconSmith,&rdquo; in the <INDEXTARGET ID="ch02.icons9"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch02.icons9|Desktop icons:creating with IconSmith --><DOCTITLE>IRIX Interactive Desktop Integration Guide</DOCTITLE>.

<PARAGRAPH>You can create your unique icon symbols in the drawing area and can readily add the predefined templates to your design. <XREF IDREF="71791" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;2-4</XREF> shows four examples of IconSmith. The drawing area in the example in the upper left corner contains the IRIS Showcase application symbol for its not-running state. The other three examples contain the three predefined templates. The icon labels are supplied automatically when the icons are displayed on the desktop. This label is the name of the executable for application icons and the name of the data file for file icons.</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Icon Size</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Draw your icon within the 100&times;100-pixel boundary box defined by IconSmith. Keep in mind that your symbol designs should allow any generic icon components, such as the magic carpet and stack of papers, to be at least partially visible.

<PARAGRAPH>By default, icons are reduced to fit within a 50x50 pixel area when they're displayed on the desktop.

<PARAGRAPH>To enable your icon to reflect what state it's in, you need to paint portions of it with the predefined <ITALICS>icon color</ITALICS> supplied by IconSmith. Those portions of your icon are changed automatically by the IRIX Interactive Desktop to indicate the icon's state. In the example shown in <XREF IDREF="79050" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;2-6</XREF>, the hat brim, the light shading on the hat, and the carpet of the IRIS Showcase application icon use the predefined <ITALICS>icon color</ITALICS> (which is a light gray in the neutral state). In addition, to make the state color changes easier for users to detect in your icons, avoid (or use sparingly) intense, strongly saturated colors and the specific colors used by the IRIX Interactive Desktop to indicate state&mdash;bright yellow, dim yellow, royal blue, pure white, and light gray.</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>To have your application icon change to reflect its running state, create two different symbols using IconSmith and associate them with your application. See Chapter&nbsp;11, &ldquo;Creating Desktop Icons: An Overview,&rdquo; in the <ITALICS>IRIX Interactive Desktop Integration Guide </ITALICS>for details on how to do this. The specific design of the two symbols is up to you, but keep in mind that you're trying to convey an inactive state and an active, running one. Also, when viewed in succession, the two symbols look like a progressive animation rather than two unrelated icons.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The IRIS Showcase application icon shown in <INDEXTARGET ID="ch02.icons20"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch02.icons20|Desktop icons:examples --><XREF IDREF="89242" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;2-8</XREF> is an example of a well-designed icon: it animates to show which state the application is in, and the carpet is always visible. <XREF IDREF="29855" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;2-9</XREF> shows three examples of application icon designs that can be improved: </PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The first example is an application icon for a point-and-click ASCII text editor. Its carpet is clearly visible and functions properly. The application symbol doesn't change, however, to reflect that the application is running. To improve the design, the existing symbol could be used to show the running state and the pencil could be aligned at the bottom or side of a blank version of the pad when the application isn't running. </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The application icon in the second example represents an online book viewer. The application symbol changes nicely to indicate its running state. The carpet, however, is almost totally obscured when the application isn't running and doesn't appear at all when the application is running. </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The third application icon represents a database application for tracking software bugs. The application symbol is visually appealing but completely obscures the carpet. In addition, there's no change in the application symbol to reflect its running state, and the symbol is oriented toward the lower left instead of the lower right. The design could be improved by adding a second symbol for the not-running state (perhaps showing the file drawer closed with the bug's antennae sticking out), making the application symbol smaller so that the magic carpet is visible, and redrawing the symbol so that it faces the lower right.</PARAGRAPH>
