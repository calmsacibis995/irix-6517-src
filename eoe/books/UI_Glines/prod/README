Production Information for:
007-2167-004
---------------------------------

This book had a very preliminary production
in May 1997. It was then put on hold, there
was no decision made for 4 color vs. black
and white print. All color files from chapter
1 through chapter 11 are the same as 007-2167-002
(the last hard copy version). 

All color files for chapters 12 through chap 15,
are either .ai (already cmyk) or need to be sep
arated for the proper print method. All CMYK files
were separated for the color print job of 007-2167-002.
(Please read the README for 007-2167-002 as well)
