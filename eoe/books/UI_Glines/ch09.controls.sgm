<CHAPTER LBL="9"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="95140">Controls</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Two types of controls are described in this chapter&mdash;those supported in the standard OSF/Motif environment (such as pushbuttons, lists, and scrollbars), and those unique to the IRIX Interactive Desktop environment (such as enhanced scales, thumbwheels, and dials). These controls can be used in any window of an application. Each description consists of a general description of the control and guidelines for when to use it, how to label it, and how it should behave.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch09.controls1"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch09.controls1|controls --></PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>A scrollbar includes the scroll region (shown as a trough), which represents the size of the entire scrollable element with arrow buttons at each end. If there's data that can be scrolled, the scrollbar also includes a slider that indicates the relative position and portion of the data currently being displayed. As the user moves the slider, a temporarily indented impression of the slider indicates the position of the slider before the user began moving it. This indented impression disappears when the user releases the mouse button to complete the scroll action. The basic operations for scrollbars are described in the section &ldquo;Other Operations,&rdquo; in the reference page for ScrollBar in the <DOCTITLE>OSF/Motif Style Guide</DOCTITLE>, Chapter 9.</PARAGRAPH>

<CHECKOFF><CHECKOFFITEM>Use scrollbars to pan an associated view.</CHECKOFFITEM>
<CHECKOFFITEM>Use scrollbars with components that can be resized such that all of the available information contained in the component can't be displayed at one time. Typical scrollable components include work areas in primary windows, lists, multiple line text fields, and data display areas in primary or support windows.</CHECKOFFITEM>
<CHECKOFFITEM>Use scrollbars with a list when the number of elements in the list doesn't fit in the viewing region (vertical scrollbar), when the elements are too wide to fit in the viewing region (horizontal scrollbar), or when the window containing the list can be resized such that either of these situations can occur. See <XREF IDREF="72866" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Lists&rdquo;</XREF> earlier in this chapter for information.</CHECKOFFITEM>
<CHECKOFFITEM>Use scrollbars with multi-line text regions when the data can't all be displayed vertically or horizontally or when the window can be resized such that this is true. See <XREF IDREF="36229" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Text Fields&rdquo;</XREF> earlier in this chapter for information.</CHECKOFFITEM>
<CHECKOFFITEM>Don't use scrollbars with single-line text fields. See <XREF IDREF="36229" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Text Fields&rdquo;</XREF> earlier in this chapter for information.</CHECKOFFITEM>
<CHECKOFFITEM>Don't use scrollbars for zooming or for rotation. Use an IRIX Interactive Desktop thumbwheel instead. See <XREF IDREF="20150" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Thumbwheels&rdquo;</XREF> later in this chapter.</CHECKOFFITEM>
<CHECKOFFITEM>Don't use scrollbars to choose a value in a range; use the IRIX Interactive Desktop scale instead.</CHECKOFFITEM>

<PARAGRAPH><BOLD>When displaying scrollbars . . .</BOLD>&space;</PARAGRAPH>
<CHECKOFF><CHECKOFFITEM>Place vertical scrollbars along the right of the element being scrolled, and place horizontal scrollbars along the bottom of the element being scrolled. </CHECKOFFITEM>
<CHECKOFFITEM>Keep scrollbars updated. When a window using a scrollbar is first opened, the scrollbar should reflect the current area being displayed in the scrolled region.</CHECKOFFITEM>
<CHECKOFFITEM>Update the data in the scrolled area continuously as the user drags the slider along the scroll region. This gives the feeling of direct, continuous control. Don't wait until the user has released the slider to update the data, because users often use the current view of the data to determine when to stop dragging the slider.</CHECKOFFITEM>
<CHECKOFFITEM>When a component is being scrolled, don't scroll it beyond the first or last elements. That is, there should be no extra white space before the first element or after the last element. The exception to this rule is scrolling text elements that represent physical pages (for example, in a desktop publishing application).</CHECKOFFITEM>
<CHECKOFFITEM>Make all components that use scrollbars automatically scroll when the user makes a selection that goes outside of the data currently being displayed. Also, make the component automatically scroll if the user performs an operation that moves the cursor outside of the current view (for example, if the user inserts or deletes text that moves the cursor outside of the current view). In this case, the view should be automatically scrolled so that the cursor is shown when the operation is finished.</CHECKOFFITEM>
<CHECKOFFITEM>When using the &lt;Page Up>, &lt;Page Down>, &lt;Ctrl>-&lt;Page Up>, or &lt;Ctrl>-&lt;Page Down> key sequences to scroll a page at a time, leave one unit of overlap from the previous page to make it easier for the user to preserve the current context. This unit is application-specific; it might be a line of text, an item in a list, a row of icons, or a specific number of pixels (for example, in a drawing region). By default, this behavior is automatic for IRIS IM list and text components.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch09.controls27"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch09.controls27|keys:special&lt;Page Up\> key&lt;Page Down\> key&lt;Ctrl\>&lt;Page Up\> keys&lt;Ctrl\>&lt;Page Down\> keys --></CHECKOFFITEM>
<CHECKOFFITEM>Remove the slider from the scrollbar when all of the data is currently being displayed. Don't remove the scrollbar or disable it in some other fashion.</CHECKOFFITEM>
<CHECKOFFITEM>Allow the user to cancel scroll actions by pressing &lt;Esc>. By default, if the user presses the &lt;Esc> key while dragging the slider along the scroll region, the scroll action is canceled, and both the data and the slider are returned to the position they had before the user initiated the scroll action.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch09.controls28"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch09.controls28|&lt;Escape\> key --></CHECKOFFITEM>
