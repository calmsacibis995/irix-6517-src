Users of 3D editing applications are especially in need of fine control and power in manipulating objects. Applications such as games that don't allow editing may need less control. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>This chapter provides guidelines for three basic manipulation techniques: translation, rotation, and scaling, and their variations. It also discusses the special case of moving the center of rotation and scaling, which applications can optionally add to the basic techniques. It includes these topics:</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>Note that because users are accustomed to manipulating objects directly, direct manipulation of 3D objects is usually preferable. In some cases, manipulating objects with the help of an intermediary like a separate dialog box can be useful, either as a secondary method or to make more precise manipulation possible. An example is a dialog box that lets users type in percentages for scaling or precise degree values for rotation.</PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="43710">Phases of 3D Manipulation</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The general paradigm for 3D object manipulation consists of several phases: manipulator display, approach, grab, drag, and release. In each of these phases, the manipulator uses certain feedback styles&mdash;neutral, locate highlight, selected, choice, and guide&mdash;to indicate the actions currently available to the user. These feedback styles are discussed in detail in <INDEXTARGET ID="ch15.3Dmanip1"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch15.3Dmanip1|3D applications:manipulation phases manipulation of 3D objects: phases phases: 3D manipulation --><XREF IDREF="85498" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;3D Manipulation Feedback&rdquo;</XREF>.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The phases of 3D manipulation are used throughout the rest of this chapter to illustrate how users perform the different manipulation operations. The phases can be summarized as follows:</PARAGRAPH>
<ORDEREDLIST><LIST><PARAGRAPH><BOLD>Manipulator Display Phase.</BOLD> The user performs an action and the manipulator is displayed in its neutral state on the selected object. As discussed in <XREF IDREF="91268" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Selection Feedback for 3D Objects&rdquo; in Chapter&nbsp;14</XREF>, manipulators usually appear when users select an object. Some applications may, however, require an additional step to have the manipulators appear. Silicon Graphics provides standard manipulators for translation, rotation, and scaling. </PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH><BOLD>Approach phase<INDEXTARGET ID="ch15.3Dmanip2"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch15.3Dmanip2|approach phase (3D manipulation) --></BOLD>. As the user moves the pointer over a control on the manipulator, the control changes to locate highlight style (for example, by changing color) to indicate that it's an active control that can be selected. </PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH><BOLD>Grab phase<INDEXTARGET ID="ch15.3Dmanip3"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch15.3Dmanip3|grab phase (3D manipulation) --></BOLD>. The user selects the control on the manipulator by positioning the pointer over it and pressing the left mouse button. </PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLISTIND><BULLETSQUAREIND><PARAGRAPH>If the selection can result in only one action, the application provides selected feedback and, if necessary, guide feedback. For example, if the user selects a scaling handle (see <XREF IDREF="26531" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;15-9</XREF>), the handle is displayed in the selected style and lines in the guide style appear to indicate the direction of dragging for the drag phase.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLETSQUAREIND>
<BULLETSQUAREIND><PARAGRAPH>If more than one action is possible, the application provides selected feedback, choice feedback and, if necessary, guide feedback. For example, if the user selects a rotation handle (see <XREF IDREF="80094" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;15-6</XREF>), the handle is displayed in the selected style, and two arrows in choice style are displayed to indicate that the user has to clarify the direction of the rotation. In addition, two rings appear in the guide style to indicate the direction of dragging for the drag phase.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLETSQUAREIND>
</BULLETLISTIND>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH><BOLD>Drag phase<INDEXTARGET ID="ch15.3Dmanip4"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch15.3Dmanip4|drag phase (3D manipulation) --></BOLD>. The user drags the selected control to manipulate the object. During the drag, the object changes in response to the user's actions. If choice feedback was provided in the grab phase, the user has to first resolve the choice by dragging the pointer in one of the choice directions. Once the choice is made, the application replaces the choice style with the selected style to indicate the choice was made. </PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH><BOLD>Release phase<INDEXTARGET ID="ch15.3Dmanip5"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch15.3Dmanip5|release phase (3D manipulation) --></BOLD>. The user releases the mouse button. The manipulator is returned to its original displayed state. </PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
</ORDEREDLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>For translation, rotation, and scaling, use the standard manipulators provided by Silicon Graphics. If you design your own manipulator and controls for actions other than translation, rotation, and scaling, be sure to include in your design:</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="85498">3D Manipulation Feedback</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Provide immediate feedback about available functionality of the manipulator at all times. Applications need to use consistent design schemes across manipulators and controls to provide this feedback and indicate the current state of the manipulator. Experience has shown that the following feedback styles, which use a design scheme based on colors, are useful: <INDEXTARGET ID="ch15.3Dmanip6"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch15.3Dmanip6|manipulation of 3D objects:feedback feedback,3D manipulation --></PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH><BOLD>Neutral<INDEXTARGET ID="ch15.3Dmanip7"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch15.3Dmanip7|selection feedback (3D) feedback styles: selection feedback --></BOLD>. Indicates that the user isn't interacting with the controls on the manipulator. Manipulators in neutral style (often green or white) stand out from the other elements in the scene.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH><BOLD>Locate highlight<INDEXTARGET ID="ch15.3Dmanip8"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch15.3Dmanip8|selection feedback (3D) feedback styles: selection feedback --></BOLD>.

<BULLET><PARAGRAPH><BOLD>Selected feedback<INDEXTARGET ID="ch15.3Dmanip9"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch15.3Dmanip9|selection feedback (3D) feedback styles: selection feedback --></BOLD>.

<BULLET><PARAGRAPH><BOLD>Choice feedback<INDEXTARGET ID="ch15.3Dmanip11"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch15.3Dmanip11|choice feedback (3D) feedback styles: choice feedback --></BOLD>. Indicates the user has selected a control but has to make an additional selection. For example, if the user wants to constrain translation to just one axis of a translation plane, the user first selects the plane for translation, then two arrows prompt the user to choose which of the two axes to translate along. Feedback in choice style (often rendered in orange) stands out but not as strongly as the selected style. <INDEXTARGET ID="ch15.3Dmanip12"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch15.3Dmanip12|orange feedback --></PARAGRAPH>

<BULLET><PARAGRAPH><BOLD>Guide feedback<INDEXTARGET ID="ch15.3Dmanip13"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch15.3Dmanip13|path feedback (3D) feedback styles: path feedback --></BOLD>. Provides supplementary information to guide the user during object manipulation. For example, when the user chooses to rotate an object, two (or three) rings indicating the rotation sphere appear to guide the user. Feedback in the guide style (often rendered in purple) recedes but is distinct from the object and the manipulator.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>In addition to the immediate feedback, continuous feedback on the state of the object is important while the user is manipulating objects. For example, as the user translates an object, the object moves in the scene in a smooth and continuous fashion so the user always knows the location of the object and can decide exactly where to position it. If the user manipulates objects in a complex scene, it may be difficult to maintain an acceptable frame rate during the manipulation, so adaptive rendering may be necessary. (See <XREF IDREF="30380" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;3D Viewing Performance and Scene Fidelity&rdquo; in Chapter&nbsp;13</XREF> for recommended frame rates and information on adaptive rendering.)</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="68038">Free and Constrained 3D Manipulation</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Depending on how complex a given operation is and how often it's used, the default manipulation is either free (in all three dimensions) or constrained.

Note that for the standard manipulators recommended by Silicon Graphics, a change in the center of rotation also changes the center of scaling.
