<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Learning About SGIHelp</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The basic unit of help information in SGIHelp is the <INDEXTARGET ID="ch04.services51"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch04.services51|help cards --><ITALICS>help card</ITALICS> (see <XREF IDREF="92392" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;4-2</XREF>, <XREF IDREF="75713" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;4-3</XREF>, and <XREF IDREF="18553" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;4-5</XREF>). Help cards typically cover one topic although they may be divided into subtopics. They can have cross-references (links) to other help cards for the application. These links appear as blue text in the help card viewer window. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Before writing online help content for SGIHelp, read through the help information for some IRIX Interactive Desktop applications to get a feel for content, functionality, and presentation. Some good examples of help in applications with a Help menu are the Directory View windows and the Icon Catalog application. Take a look at the User Manager (accessed from the System menu in the Toolchest) as an example of a utility that provides help through a Help button. Also try out the <BUTTON>Help</BUTTON> button in dialogs in the desktop applications.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>As you experiment with SGIHelp, follow some (blue) hypertext links to other help topics. Trace these cross-reference links both forward and backward. Look at the presentation of inline figures. Print some of the help information. Bring up the help index and search this index for specific keywords and phrases. Be sure to try out the &ldquo;Click for Help&rdquo; facility to get a feel for how specific the information is when you click on an area of the window.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Creating Help Cards</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Online help is designed to be presented in short pieces (chunks) of information that answer specific questions. (See <XREF IDREF="35470" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Types of Online Help&rdquo;</XREF> earlier in this chapter for a list of the types of questions users ask and the types of information that should be available in your online help to answer these questions.) Each help topic consists of one card of information that answers a specific question. The SGIHelp viewer is designed to take up no more than one quarter of the screen. If a help card has more information than will fit in the viewer window at one time, the user can use the scroll bar to scroll through the information. Each help card should span no more than three viewer windows of information to minimize scrolling. The content shouldn't assume that users have read other help topics. Sometimes a help card may depend on another help card. It's better to provide a link to the supplementary card than to repeat the information.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>All help cards have titles. Make each title as descriptive as possible to tell the reader what's contained in the specific help card. The titles should also appear in an index of help topics. Users can display the list of help topics in the index by choosing &ldquo;Index&rdquo; from the Help menu. Note that the topics listed in the index should match the titles of the help cards as closely as possible.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>As in any form of documentation, use familiar terminology and natural, friendly, real-world language. Remember that when users access online help, they're often searching for a quick answer to a specific question. This isn't the time to teach them new technical terms. </PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Writing Context-Sensitive Help</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Before the writing process begins for context-sensitive help, list all appropriate window components that users might need help on. Describe components in terms of the user tasks they support. That is, don't just say what the component is&mdash;tell users when they would find this component useful. Be careful not to mix specific step-by-step instructions with the context-sensitive information; instead, you might include links to the appropriate task-oriented information. <INDEXTARGET ID="ch04.services52"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch04.services52|online help:context-sensitive:writing help contentcontext-sensitive help:writing help content --><XREF IDREF="75713" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;4-3</XREF> shows the help card for context-sensitive help on the shelf area in a Directory View window. </PARAGRAPH>

If the instructions span more than three or four viewer windows of information, try to divide this topic into several smaller help topics. In addition to the step-by-step information, provide a brief summary paragraph at the beginning of the help card.

Note that it displays the summary paragraph and the initial steps in the in the first viewer window of information. Remember that when displayed in a Help menu, the list of tasks gives users a quick overview of what the application can do, before they've even had to look at a help card. Make sure that you have descriptive titles for your task-oriented help cards and review them as a group. See <XREF IDREF="92392" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;4-2</XREF>. </PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Writing Index Information</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Users access the help index to browse or to search for specific topics, so it's important to have descriptive titles for your help cards. The help index presents topics roughly in the order in which they appear in the Help menu: overview, list of tasks, context-sensitive topics, and keyboard shortcuts. If the application has more than one window with a Help menu, the help topics are grouped by windows.

<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Writing Keyboard Shortcut Information</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Every Help menu should have a &ldquo;Keys &amp; Shortcuts&rdquo; entry containing all the mnemonics, keyboard accelerators, and function keys for the entire application. Typically, this help card contains an introductory description and a three-column table containing columns for the menu entry label, keyboard accelerator, and mnemonic. Also include information on function keys and other shortcuts that can be used in your application.

To make it easier for users to navigate through this amount of information, after the overview information at the beginning of the help card, place links which take users directly to the other chunks of help information contained in the card. This strategy greatly reduces the amount of scrolling and searching necessary.

<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The File Manager relies on FAM to track any changes to directories and/or files that are visible on the user's desktop or in any open Directory View windows. When FAM notifies the File Manager of any changes, the File Manager updates the views. This guarantees that the user always sees an accurate view of the file system, both on the desktop and in the Directory View windows.</PARAGRAPH>
