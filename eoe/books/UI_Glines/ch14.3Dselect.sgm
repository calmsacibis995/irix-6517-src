<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="43482">3D Selection Concepts and Models</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>This section first discusses the object-action paradigm and then contrasts two techniques for selecting objects: direct selection and indirect selection. It then presents the selection models and minimum selection actions users expect in a 3D application. These techniques extend the 2D-oriented OSF/Motif guidelines for selection (see <XREF IDREF="59818" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Selection&rdquo; in Chapter&nbsp;7</XREF>). </PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>The Object-Action Paradigm in 3D Applications</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>In the object-action paradigm, the user first selects an object or a group of objects and then applies an action to the objects in the selection (see <INDEXTARGET ID="ch14.3Dselect2"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch14.3Dselect2|object-action paradigm --><XREF IDREF="59818" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Selection&rdquo; in Chapter&nbsp;7</XREF> for details). Object selection is the prerequisite to other operations. As a shortcut, selecting and manipulating the object can sometimes be combined (see &ldquo;Drag and Drop for Non-Text Objects&rdquo; in Chapter 7, &ldquo;Focus, Selection, and Drag and Drop&rdquo;). For example, users may move the pointer over an object, press and hold the mouse button, and thereby select and drag the object at the same time.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Each 3D application must have a current selection to which the action is applied at any time. The current selection may be empty (that is, no selection). Note that if your application supports several viewports, each window can maintain a separate selection, but there is only one current selection. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Some applications use an action-object paradigm instead: The user selects an action, then chooses the object to which the action should apply, and exits by returning to the selection rule (neutral state). This paradigm can be useful for tools that attach to the pointing device. In most cases, however, a user interface using an action-object paradigm tends to be excessively modal and cumbersome to use, and this paradigm isn't recommended.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="30444">Direct Selection in 3D Applications</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Direct selection means that the user selects one or more objects by selecting the objects themselves, not an indirect representation of them (for example, the name of an object in a list). Because users of 2D applications are accustomed to direct selection, using direct selection in 3D applications makes these applications easier to learn. Direct selection is therefore the preferred primary selection mechanism.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch14.3Dselect3"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch14.3Dselect3|direct selection selections:direct selection (3D) --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Direct selection can be used to select one or more objects, as follows:</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>To select a single object, the user moves the pointer over an object and presses the left mouse button. As the user clicks, the application determines which object is selected by following a ray projected into the scene. The first object the ray intersects is selected. </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>To add objects to the current selection (or remove them from the current selection), the user holds the &lt;Ctrl> key while clicking on individual objects. Objects which are not currently selected become selected, while currently selected objects are deselected.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>To select several objects at the same time, the user presses the left mouse button and drags around a group of objects. When the user releases the mouse button, all objects inside the drag area are selected. This is referred to as sweep selection. There are two variants of this technique:</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLISTIND><BULLETIND><PARAGRAPH><BOLD>Rectangle-drag</BOLD>. The user drags the pointer to define the diagonal of a rectangular area on the screen. All objects inside this rectangle are selected.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLETIND>
<BULLETIND><PARAGRAPH><BOLD>Lasso-drag</BOLD>. The user draws out an irregularly shaped area with the pointer. All objects inside this area are selected.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLETIND>
</BULLETLISTIND>
<PARAGRAPH>In both cases, the initial mouse-down action doesn't make a selection but sets the point of origin for the area to be selected. When the user releases the mouse button to complete the drag operation, the selected region is defined by the boundaries of the drag and extends from the user's current z position back to the full length of the viewing frustum. All objects, completely visible or partly obscured, that fall in this region are considered to be in the selected region. </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>Note that some applications may need to provide sub-object selection methods to allow users to select vertices, edges, and faces. This isn't discussed in this document. </PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Indirect Selection in 3D Applications</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>In indirect selection, the user selects an object by selecting an indirect representation of it. For example, assume that the names of all the objects in a 3D scene appear in a scrolling list and the user can click on a name in the list to select the object. Other examples are using a &ldquo;Select All&rdquo; menu command, which allows users to select all objects in a 3D scene, and selecting up and down a text representation of the object hierarchy. <INDEXTARGET ID="ch14.3Dselect4"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch14.3Dselect4|object hierarchy:selecting up and down 3D object hierarchy selections:in 3D object hierarchy --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Indirect selection is a useful secondary selection mechanism. It can be especially useful in 3D applications because:<INDEXTARGET ID="ch14.3Dselect5"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch14.3Dselect5|indirect selection selections:indirect selection --></PARAGRAPH>

<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>An object may be obscured or too far away in the scene to be easily selected using direct selection. </PARAGRAPH>

The bounding box needs to be differently shaped or larger than the object itself so that it's readily visible. Using a distinct color for the box is also highly recommended.</PARAGRAPH>

</FIGURE>
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Note that for some applications a bounding box may not be the most intuitive or useful shape. For example, some applications might use a bounding volume that's a pyramid or cone. Other applications might use a shape that uses planes that don't form a closed bounding volume. In most cases, however, users find the bounding box the most intuitive shape. The term bounding box is used in this document to mean a bounding box or a bounding volume.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch14.3Dselect9"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch14.3Dselect9|bounding volume --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Bounding box selection feedback is most appropriate for applications where users can select objects but either don't typically manipulate them (translate, rotate, scale) or can't manipulate them. This type of feedback is appropriate for both applications that support the single selection model and applications that support the discontiguous selection model (see <XREF IDREF="25233" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;3D Selection Models&rdquo;</XREF>).</PARAGRAPH>

A manipulator is a control that allows users to change the position, orientation, or scale of objects.

<PARAGRAPH>Manipulator selection feedback is most appropriate for applications where users typically select objects to perform manipulations on them. For these applications, placing the manipulator on an object as soon as the object is selected has two advantages:</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The manipulator feedback clearly indicates that the object is selected.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The immediate display of the manipulator makes the manipulation functions readily available.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>If your application allows users to select more than one object at a time (see the description of the discontiguous selection model in <XREF IDREF="25233" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;3D Selection Models&rdquo;</XREF>), you need to decide whether to use manipulators as selection feedback on all or just some of the selected objects. Displaying a manipulator on all selected objects may make it more difficult for users to select and interact with a specific object's manipulator and may impede performance. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>As an alternative, some applications support the concept of a lead object (see <XREF IDREF="29468" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Lead Objects in 3D Applications&rdquo;</XREF>). The lead object has the manipulator as the selection feedback and other selected objects have bounding boxes as the selection feedback (see <XREF IDREF="99300" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Lead Object When Selecting Multiple Objects&rdquo;</XREF>). </PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>This technique is most appropriate for experiential consumer applications that allow users, for example, to explore an architectural model or a museum.

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="29468">Lead Objects in 3D Applications</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>If your application allows users to select more than one object at a time, consider identifying one of those objects as the lead object (also sometimes called the master object).

<PARAGRAPH>The lead object is clearly distinguished from other objects in the selection. For example as shown in <XREF IDREF="16507" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;14-3</XREF>, if users typically select objects to manipulate them, the manipulator can be used to distinguish the lead object and bounding boxes can be used as selection feedback on other selected objects (see <XREF IDREF="53761" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Manipulator Selection Feedback&rdquo;</XREF>). </PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>This difference between the 2D-oriented OSF/Motif guidelines and these 3D guidelines is necessary because it allows users to quickly change the lead object in a 3D application. For example, to change the lead object to one that's currently not selected, a user can use click or &lt;Ctrl>-click to select that object. To change the lead object to one that's already selected, the user can click or &lt;Ctrl>-click twice on the object: the first time to deselect it and the second time to make it the most recently selected object.</PARAGRAPH>

Alternatively, a user may import a grouped object, place it in the scene, then ungroup the collection, leading to the selection of all objects that were previously grouped (see <XREF IDREF="67603" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Lead Object During Grouping and Ungrouping&rdquo;</XREF>). In these situations, make the lead object the one that's closest to the camera and closest to the middle of the viewing window.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>When the user deselects the lead object, move back through the previous lead objects making the most recent lead object that's still selected the new lead object. </PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>When the user ungroups a grouped collection of objects, for example, by selecting the group and choosing an Ungroup command, each object in that group becomes selected. The object from the group that's closest to the camera and closest to the middle of the viewing window becomes the lead object. <XREF IDREF="25793" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;14-4</XREF> shows a grouped collection of objects and <XREF IDREF="97531" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;14-5</XREF> shows the same group ungrouped. After ungrouping, the knight is the lead object because it's closest to the camera and closest to the middle of the viewing window. In this example, the lead object uses the manipulator to distinguish it from other selected objects. </PARAGRAPH>
