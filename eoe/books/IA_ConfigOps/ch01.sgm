<CHAPTER ID="LE70448-PARENT"><TITLE ID="LE70448-TITLE">Introduction to System Configuration and Operation</TITLE><PARA>One of the first jobs of a system administrator is to bring a system online with an existing network (or standing alone), and to configure the system to meet the needs for which the system was installed. This configuration usually involves installing any necessary software and hardware, setting the name and network address of the system, creating accounts for the expected users, and generally taking a system from out-of-the-box uniformity and customizing it to meet your preferences and your user's needs.</PARA>
<PARA>The tasks of installing necessary hardware are described in the documentation for the hardware. Software installation is described in the <CITETITLE><LINK BOOK="IA_InstLicns" EXTREF="29804">IRIX Admin: Software Installation and Licensing</LINK>
</CITETITLE> volume. This guide describes the tasks you perform once the system has been powered-up, to bring a system from its initial distributed state to the state in which you or your users will use it.</PARA>
<PARA>This guide assists you by describing the procedure you&mdash;the system administrator&mdash;use to configure systems and by explaining the reasons why these procedures exist and why they work the way they do. Some of these tasks are typically performed only at times of major change&mdash;when a system is commissioned, when ownership changes, or when there has been a significant hardware upgrade. Others are ongoing tasks or tasks that may come up during standard usage of an installed system.</PARA>
<PARA>As system administrator, you should familiarize yourself with the graphical interface tools available through the System Manager. You can conveniently perform many common administrative tasks with this tool. This document does not describe the System Manager, but instead discusses how to use the command-line and file interface to perform administrative functions.</PARA>
<PARA>This chapter provides information on the general nature of IRIX system administration. There are many good books on system administration listed in <XREF LINKEND="LE88344-TITLE"> of this guide, and these are available through computer bookstores. SGI systems are similar to those described in many of these books, and they are different in significant areas as well. The principles of good system administration, though, are constant.</PARA><SECTION><TITLE>Principles of Good System Administration</TITLE><PARA>The following sections outline basic principles of good system administration. Each administrator must make individual decisions about the best practices for a site. The principles discussed here are generally considered to be wise and safe practices.</PARA>

To make your site as secure as possible, each user should have an account, with a unique user ID number, and each account should have a password. Users should never give out their passwords to anyone else under any circumstances. For more information on passwords and system security, see the <CITETITLE><LINK BOOK="IA_BakSecAcc" EXTREF="70848">IRIX Admin: Backup, Security, and Accounting</LINK>

</SECTION>
<SECTION><TITLE>Superuser (root) Account Access Restriction</TITLE><PARA>Most system administration is performed while the system administrator is logged in as <LITERAL>root</LITERAL> (the superuser). This account is different from an ordinary user account because <LITERAL>root</LITERAL> has access to all system files and is not constrained by the usual system of permissions that control access to files, directories, and programs. The <LITERAL>root</LITERAL> account exists so that the administrator can perform all necessary tasks on the system while maintaining the privacy of user files and the integrity of system files. Other operating systems that do not differentiate between users have little or no means of providing for the privacy of users' files or for keeping system files uncorrupted. UNIX-based systems place the power to override system permissions and to change system files only with the <LITERAL>root</LITERAL> account.</PARA>
<PARA>All administrators at your site should have regular user accounts for their ordinary user tasks. The <LITERAL>root</LITERAL> account should be used only for necessary system administration tasks. </PARA>
<PARA><INDEXTERM ID="ITch01-4"><PRIMARY>site policies</PRIMARY>
<SECONDARY>root access</SECONDARY>
</INDEXTERM>
To obtain the best security on a multiuser system, restrict access to the <LITERAL>root</LITERAL> account. On workstations, the primary user of the workstation can generally use the <LITERAL>root</LITERAL> account safely, though most users should not have access to the <LITERAL>root</LITERAL> account on other user's workstations.</PARA>
<PARA>Make it a policy to give <LITERAL>root</LITERAL> passwords to as few people as is practical. Some sites maintain locked file cabinets of <LITERAL>root</LITERAL> passwords so that the passwords are not widely distributed but are available in an emergency.</PARA>

</INDEXTERM>
On a multiuser system, users may have access to personal files that belong to others. Such access can be controlled by setting file permissions with the <COMMAND>chmod(1)</COMMAND> command. Default permissions are controlled by the <COMMAND>umask</COMMAND> shell parameter. <INDEXTERM ID="ITch01-6"><PRIMARY>permissions</PRIMARY>
<SECONDARY>default</SECONDARY>
</INDEXTERM>
(See <XREF LINKEND="LE18140-TITLE"> for information on setting <COMMAND>umask</COMMAND>.)</PARA>
<PARA>By default, it is easy for users to exchange data because permission to read files is granted to everyone. Users can change this default for their own files. However, many users do not set their <COMMAND>umask</COMMAND>s, and they forget to change the access permissions of personal files. Make sure users are aware of file permissions and of your policy on examining other users' personal files. You can make this policy as lenient or stringent as you deem necessary.</PARA>

<SECTION  ID="LE25360-PARENT"><TITLE  ID="LE25360-TITLE">Password File Check</TITLE><PARA>At least once a week, run the <COMMAND>pwck(1M)</COMMAND> and <COMMAND>grpck(1M)</COMMAND> programs to check your <FILENAME>/etc/passwd</FILENAME> and <FILENAME>/etc/group</FILENAME> files for errors. You can automate this process using the <COMMAND>cron(1)</COMMAND> command, and you can direct <COMMAND>cron</COMMAND> to mail the results of the checks to your user account. For more information on using <COMMAND>cron</COMMAND> to automate your routine tasks, see <XREF LINKEND="LE60523-TITLE">..</PARA><PARA>The <COMMAND>pwck</COMMAND> and <COMMAND>grpck</COMMAND> commands read the password and group files and report any incorrect or inconsistent entries. Any inconsistency with normal IRIX operation is reported. For example, if you have <FILENAME>/etc/passwd</FILENAME> entries for two user names with the same user identification (UID) number, <COMMAND>pwck</COMMAND> reports this as an error. <COMMAND>grpck</COMMAND> performs a similar function on the <FILENAME>/etc/group</FILENAME> file. The standard <FILENAME>passwd</FILENAME> file shipped with the system can generate several errors.</PARA>

<SECTION><TITLE>Software Upgrade Check</TITLE><PARA>Changing the software also affects the system, even if the change you make is as trivial as a small upgrade to a new version of an application. Some software installations can overwrite customized configuration files.

<PARA>Many administrative tasks require the system to be shut down to a run level other than the multiuser state. This means that conventional users cannot access the system. Just before the system is taken out of the multiuser state, users on the system are requested to log off. You should do these types of tasks when they interfere the least with the activities of the user community.</PARA>
<PARA>Sometimes situations arise that require the system to be taken down with little or no notice provided to the users. This is often unavoidable, but try to give at least 5 to 15 minutes notice, if possible.</PARA>

In addition to the system log, you may find it helpful to keep a user trouble log. The problems that users encounter fall into patterns. If you keep a record of how problems are resolved, you do not have to start from scratch when a problem recurs. Also, a user trouble log can be very useful for training new administrators in the specifics of your local system, and for helping them learn what to expect.</PARA>
