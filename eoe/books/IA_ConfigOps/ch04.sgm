<PARA>If a piece of peripheral hardware installed on your system does not appear in the <COMMAND>hinv</COMMAND> output, it may or may not be an indication of trouble with your hardware. Some peripherals connected to the system by a board on a VME bus are not identified when running <COMMAND>hinv</COMMAND> from the command monitor. To list the missing peripheral, enter <COMMAND>hinv</COMMAND> at a system shell prompt. If your peripheral is still not recognized, reseat the board or device in its socket and check that it is using the correct SCSI address. If this does not relieve the problem, the hardware itself may be defective. Note also that most devices are not recognized by <COMMAND>hinv</COMMAND> until after the <COMMAND>MAKEDEV</COMMAND> command has been run after their installation.</PARA>

<SECTION  ID="LE77121-PARENT"><TITLE  ID="LE77121-TITLE">Checking Installed Hardware in /hw</TITLE><PARA>The contents of the <FILENAME>/hw</FILENAME> directory structure are updated as necessary by the <COMMAND>ioconfig</COMMAND> command run from <FILENAME>/etc/brc</FILENAME> at boot time (see <XREF LINKEND="LE45959-PARENT"> and <COMMAND>ioconfig(1M)</COMMAND> for more information). All recognized hardware should be represented by an entry under <FILENAME>/hw</FILENAME>, and some of these entries will have symbolic links in other parts of the <FILENAME>/hw</FILENAME> structure as well as <FILENAME>/dev</FILENAME>.</PARA>
<PARA>For example, the system <LITERAL>root</LITERAL> partition may appear in the following entries:</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>
/hw/scsi_ctlr/1/target/1/lun/0/disk/partition/0/block
/hw/disk/root
/dev/root
</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>The first entry (<FILENAME>/hw/scsi_ctlr/</FILENAME> and so on) represents the physical location of the board as described in <COMMAND>hwgraph(4D)</COMMAND>. The second and third paths shown above (<FILENAME>/hw/disk/root</FILENAME> and <FILENAME>/dev/root</FILENAME>) are symbolic links to the long physical pathname (the first path above). The symbolic links serve as a convenient shorthand for the various system commands that need to reference the device.</PARA>

</INDEXTERM>
With each system restart (for example, after a reboot, shutdown, halt, <COMMAND>init</COMMAND> command, or power off), the startup routine probes for hardware devices on all the systems connected into the CrayLink interconnection fabric. All the slots and links in all the modules within the fabric are probed.</PARA>
<PARA>The routine then creates a hierarchical filesystem, called the <INDEXTERM ID="ITch04-4"><PRIMARY>hardware graph</PRIMARY>
</INDEXTERM>
hardware graph, that lists all the hardware that is located. The top of the hardware graph is visible at <FILENAME>/hw</FILENAME>. For complete details, see the man page for <COMMAND>hwgraph(4D)</COMMAND>.</PARA>
<PARA>After the hardware graph is completed, the <COMMAND>ioconfig</COMMAND> program assigns a unit number to each located device that needs one. Other programs (for example, <COMMAND>hinv</COMMAND> and the device's driver) read the assigned number and use it.</PARA>
<PARA>On an initial startup, <COMMAND>ioconfig</COMMAND> assigns numbers sequentially; for example, if two IRIS ATM XIO boards are found, they are numbered <LITERAL>unit0</LITERAL> (with ports 0 to 3) and <LITERAL>unit1</LITERAL> (with ports 4 to 7).</PARA>
<PARA>On subsequent startups, <COMMAND>ioconfig</COMMAND> distinguishes between hardware that it has seen before and new items. To previously seen items, it assigns the same unit and port numbers that were assigned on the initial startup. To new hardware, it assigns new sequential numbers. <COMMAND>ioconfig</COMMAND> never reassigns a number, even if the device that had the number is removed and leaves a gap in the numbering.</PARA>
<PARA>New items are differentiated from previously-seen items based on the hardware graph listing (that is, the path within <FILENAME>/hw</FILENAME>). The database of previously-seen devices is kept in the <FILENAME>/etc/ioconfig.conf</FILENAME> file. For example, a replacement board (exact same name) that is installed into the location of an old board will be assigned the old board's numbers, while a board that is moved from one location to another will be assigned a new unit number and new port numbers.</PARA>

You can use the <COMMAND>chkconfig(1M)</COMMAND> command to change some aspects of system configuration. To determine which aspects of a system you can alter with <COMMAND>chkconfig</COMMAND>, enter the <COMMAND>chkconfig</COMMAND> command:</PARA>
<LITERALLAYOUT>
<USERINPUT>chkconfig</USERINPUT>&ensp;
</LITERALLAYOUT>
<PARA>You see a list of configuration options, which are described in <XREF LINKEND="LE55726-TITLE">.. If you use the <LITERAL>-s</LITERAL> option, you see a list that is sorted by whether the configuration item is on or off.</PARA>
<PARA>To change a configuration option, use the <COMMAND>chkconfig</COMMAND> command with two arguments: the name of the option you wish to change and the new status of the configuration (on or off). You must have <LITERAL>root</LITERAL> privilege to change a system configuration.</PARA>
<PARA>For example, to turn on detailed process accounting, log in either as <LITERAL>root</LITERAL> or as the system administrator, and enter:</PARA>
<LITERALLAYOUT>
<USERINPUT>chkconfig acct on</USERINPUT>
</LITERALLAYOUT>
<PARA>To turn off process accounting, enter:</PARA>
<LITERALLAYOUT>
<USERINPUT>chkconfig acct off</USERINPUT>
</LITERALLAYOUT>
<PARA>Some aspects of system configuration do not take effect until the system is shut down and rebooted because startup scripts, which are in the directory <FILENAME>/etc/init.d</FILENAME>, are run when the system is booted and brought to multiuser mode. These scripts read the files that <COMMAND>chkconfig</COMMAND> sets to determine which daemons to start.</PARA>
<PARA>Some configuration items that can be controlled by <COMMAND>chkconfig</COMMAND> may not be displayed by <COMMAND>chkconfig</COMMAND>. These include:</PARA>
<DEFLIST><DEFLISTENTRY><TERM><LITERAL>nostickytmp</LITERAL> </TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>Sets <FIRSTTERM>sticky</FIRSTTERM> behavior for the directory <FILENAME>/tmp</FILENAME>. When the directory is sticky, (with <LITERAL>nostickytmp</LITERAL> set to <LITERAL>off</LITERAL>), users may not remove files from the directory unless they own the files, have explicit permission to remove the files (write permission), or have superuser privileges.</PARA>
<PARA>The opposite behavior allows users to remove or replace files in <FILENAME>/tmp</FILENAME>, which is a publicly writable directory, even if they do not own the files. This is handy behavior if you have users who need to create large temporary files and you are short on disk space. But it is better to increase disk space to avoid important files being removed. </PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</DEFLISTENTRY>
<DEFLISTENTRY><TERM><LITERAL>nocleantmp</LITERAL> </TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>Controls whether or not the directory <FILENAME>/tmp</FILENAME> is cleaned out each time the system is booted. If <LITERAL>nocleantmp</LITERAL> is <LITERAL>on</LITERAL>, <FILENAME>/tmp</FILENAME> is not cleaned. If <LITERAL>nocleantmp</LITERAL> is off, all files in <FILENAME>/tmp</FILENAME> are removed each time the system is started.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>
</DEFLISTENTRY>
</DEFLIST>
<PARA>If you want to see these flags in the <COMMAND>chkconfig</COMMAND> menu, you can use the <LITERAL>-f</LITERAL> option to force <COMMAND>chkconfig</COMMAND> to create a configuration file for the options:</PARA>
<LITERALLAYOUT>
<USERINPUT>chkconfig -f nocleantmp on</USERINPUT>
</LITERALLAYOUT>
<PARA>In this example, <COMMAND>chkconfig</COMMAND> creates a configuration file called <FILENAME>nocleantmp</FILENAME> in the directory <FILENAME>/etc/config</FILENAME>, which flags the system not remove files from <FILENAME>/tmp</FILENAME> at reboot.</PARA>

If you have a multiprocessor system, the <COMMAND>mpadmin(1M)</COMMAND> command and the Miser suite of commands allow you to change the way programs are assigned to the various processors on your system. To determine if your system is multiprocessor, use the <COMMAND>hinv(1M)</COMMAND> command. A multiprocessor system returns information similar to the following in its <COMMAND>hinv</COMMAND> output:</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>
Processor 0: 40 MHZ IP7
Processor 1: 36 MHZ IP7
Processor 2: 40 MHZ IP7

<PARA>A single-processor system returns information similar to the following for the <COMMAND>hinv</COMMAND> command:</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>
1 100 MHZ IP22 Processor
</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>If you have only one processor on your system (and the vast majority of systems have only one processor), this command still operates, though it has no useful purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>The <COMMAND>mpadmin</COMMAND> command allows you to turn off processors, report various states of the processors, and move system functions such as the system clock to specific processors. For complete information on <COMMAND>mpadmin(1M)</COMMAND>, see the man page.</PARA>
<PARA>For partitioning of the system in a batch environment, the batch scheduling component of Miser should be used. Miser allows for fine-grained control of memory and CPU allocations between batch applications, and between batch and interactive applications. For information on Miser, see <CITETITLE>IRIX Admin: Resource Administration</CITETITLE>.</PARA>
<PARA>For partitioning the system between different user groups in a strictly interactive environment, the <COMMAND>miser_cpuset</COMMAND> command can be used. This command allows the system to be partitioned into different CPU sets whose access is restricted to particular user groups. The <COMMAND>miser_cpuset</COMMAND> command can be used to create, destroy, and display these CPU sets. For complete information on <COMMAND>miser_cpuset(1M)</COMMAND>, see the man page.</PARA>

</INDEXTERM>
into three relationships. The three relationships are the owner of the file, the owner's user group, and all users. If you view a long listing of a directory, you see that the permissions field for each file in the directory looks something like this:</PARA>
<LITERALLAYOUT>
-rwxrwxrwx
</LITERALLAYOUT>
<PARA>Note that the line of permissions has the string <LITERAL>rwx</LITERAL> repeated three times. The first instance of <LITERAL>rwx</LITERAL> applies to the file owner, the next instance applies to the group members, and the third applies to all other users on the system. The example above shows full permissions. A more restricted permission set might look like this:</PARA>
<LITERALLAYOUT>
-rw-r--r--
</LITERALLAYOUT>
<PARA>The three categories of permissions are <FIRSTTERM>read</FIRSTTERM>, <FIRSTTERM>write</FIRSTTERM>, and <FIRSTTERM>execute</FIRSTTERM>. They are denoted as <LITERAL>r</LITERAL> for read, <LITERAL>w</LITERAL> for write, and <LITERAL>x</LITERAL> for execute in long listings of files. To get a long listing, enter the following command at your system prompt in any directory:</PARA>
<LITERALLAYOUT>
<USERINPUT>ls -l</USERINPUT>
</LITERALLAYOUT>
<PARA>Along with the permission information, the <COMMAND>ls -l</COMMAND> command lists the owners and the sizes of the files and the date they were last modified.</PARA>
<PARA>Read permission allows you to look at the contents of a file. Write permission allows you to make changes to or remove a file. Execute permission allows you to run the file as a command from your shell prompt.</PARA>
<PARA>Each character is separately significant in the permissions listing. Starting at the left, the first character is a dash. A dash in any other position means that no permission is granted and the actions associated with that permission are denied. However, in the left-most place, the contents of that space describes whether the file is a file or a directory. If it is a directory, a <LITERAL>d</LITERAL> appears in that space. Other characters in this place indicate that the file is a pipe, a block or character special device file, or other type of file. See the <COMMAND>ls(1)</COMMAND> man page.</PARA>
<PARA>To see the current status of a file's permission settings, use the <COMMAND>ls -l</COMMAND> command. For example, to see the status of permission on the file <FILENAME>review</FILENAME>, enter:</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>
<USERINPUT>ls -l review</USERINPUT>

<PARA>Permissions are shown as read (<LITERAL>r</LITERAL>), write (<LITERAL>w</LITERAL>), and execute (<LITERAL>x</LITERAL>), for each of user, group, and other, respectively. That is, each of the user, group, and everyone else has some combination of read, write, and execute access to the file. After the first character (in this example, a dash), the next three characters give the read, write, and execute permission for the user, the next three characters give the read, write, and execute access for the group, and the last three characters give the read, write, and execute access for everyone else. So in the example, user <LITERAL>jones</LITERAL> has read (<LITERAL>r</LITERAL>) and write (<LITERAL>w</LITERAL>), access to the file <FILENAME>review</FILENAME>, while the group has only read (<LITERAL>r</LITERAL>) access, and other also has only read (<LITERAL>r</LITERAL>) access. Nobody has execute (<LITERAL>x</LITERAL>) permission.</PARA>
<PARA>The superuser or owner of the file can change these permission settings. As superuser, you can give everyone write access to a file with the <COMMAND>chmod</COMMAND> command. For example, to add write access for the group and others to the <FILENAME>review</FILENAME> file, use the <LITERAL>go+w</LITERAL> (<LITERAL>g</LITERAL> for group, <LITERAL>o</LITERAL> for other, and <LITERAL>+w</LITERAL> to permit writing) option as follows:</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>
<USERINPUT>chmod go+w review</USERINPUT>
</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>Now the access permissions should look like this:</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>

</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>Another way of controlling permission settings is with the octal number representation obtained by using 7 as representing read, write and execute permission (4+2+1). In this way, to give complete read, write, and execute permissions to a file, use the <COMMAND>chmod 777</COMMAND> command, and to give just read permission to the owner and no other permissions at all, use <COMMAND>chmod 400</COMMAND>. For complete information on setting access permissions on files and directories, refer to the <COMMAND>chmod(1)</COMMAND> man page.</PARA>
<NOTE><PARA>If you use <COMMAND>chmod</COMMAND> on a device file, edit the <FILENAME>/etc/ioperms file</FILENAME> to reflect the change, or the device file returns to the default access permissions after a reboot. The format of an entry in <FILENAME>/etc/ioperms</FILENAME> is:</PARA>
</NOTE>
<PROGRAMLISTING>
<REPLACEABLE>device_name owner group nnn</REPLACEABLE>
</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA><REPLACEABLE>device_name</REPLACEABLE> is the device filename, <REPLACEABLE>owner</REPLACEABLE> is the file owner, <REPLACEABLE>group</REPLACEABLE> is the group, and <REPLACEABLE>nnn</REPLACEABLE> is the octal permission setting as described above and in the <COMMAND>chmod(1)</COMMAND> man page. Refer to the <COMMAND>ioconfig(1M)</COMMAND> man page for details on device permission settings in the <FILENAME>/etc/ioperms</FILENAME> file.</PARA>

are slightly different. For example, read permission on a directory means that you can use the <COMMAND>ls</COMMAND> command to look at the contents of that directory. Write permission allows you to add, change, or remove files in that directory. (However, even though you may have write permission in that directory, you must also have write permission on the individual files to change or remove them, unless you own the directory.) Finally, execute permission on a directory allows you to use the <COMMAND>cd</COMMAND> command to change directories into that directory.</PARA>
</SECTION>
<SECTION><TITLE>File Permissions </TITLE><PARA>The first series of three places after the leftmost place in the permissions field describe the permissions for the owner of the file. Here is an example of <INDEXTERM ID="ITch04-32"><PRIMARY>file permissions</PRIMARY>

<LITERALLAYOUT>
-rwx------ 1 owner grp 6680 Apr 24 16:26 shell.script
</LITERALLAYOUT>
<PARA>The file is not a directory, so the leftmost space is blank. The characters <LITERAL>rwx</LITERAL> indicate that the owner of the file, <LITERAL>owner</LITERAL>, has read, write, and execute permission on this file. The second series of three spaces describe permissions for the owner's group. In this case, the group is <LITERAL>grp</LITERAL>. Suppose permissions for this file were slightly different, like this:</PARA>
<LITERALLAYOUT>
-rwxr-x--- 1 owner grp 6680 Apr 24 16:26 shell.script
</LITERALLAYOUT>
<PARA>In that case, any member of the group <LITERAL>grp</LITERAL> could read or execute the file, but not change it or remove it. All members of group <LITERAL>grp</LITERAL> can share a pool of files that are individually owned. Through careful use of group read and write permissions, you can create a set of document source files that are owned by one person, but any group member can work on them.</PARA>
<PARA>The third series of spaces provides for all other users on the system and is called the public permissions. A file that is set to be readable by any user on the system is called <FIRSTTERM>publicly readable</FIRSTTERM>.</PARA>

You can use <COMMAND>chmod</COMMAND> only to change files that you own. Generally, you use this command to protect files you want to keep secret or private, to protect private directories, and to grant permissions to files that need to be used by others. To restrict access to a file or directory to yourself only, enter:</PARA>
<LITERALLAYOUT>
<USERINPUT>chmod 600 </USERINPUT><REPLACEABLE>filename</REPLACEABLE>
<USERINPUT>chmod 700 </USERINPUT><REPLACEABLE>dirname</REPLACEABLE>
</LITERALLAYOUT>
<PARA>Other permissions may be added by using the <COMMAND>chmod</COMMAND> command with the letter associated with the permission. For example, to add general write permission to a file, enter: </PARA>
<LITERALLAYOUT>

 the <COMMAND>umask</COMMAND> command in your <FILENAME>.cshrc</FILENAME>, <FILENAME>.profile</FILENAME>, or <FILENAME>.login</FILENAME> file. There is a default <COMMAND>umask</COMMAND> setting for the entire system in the <FILENAME>/etc/profile</FILENAME> and <FILENAME>/etc/cshrc</FILENAME> files. By changing the setting of your <COMMAND>umask</COMMAND>, you can alter the default permissions on your files and directories to any available DAC permission. See the <COMMAND>umask(1)</COMMAND> man page for more information.</PARA>
<PARA>A drawback to the <COMMAND>umask</COMMAND> command is that it makes every file you create receive the same permissions. For most purposes, you want the files you create to be accessible by the members of your group. For example, if an individual is suddenly called away and another person must take over that person's portion of a project, the source files must be accessible by the new user. However, you might want the personal files you keep in your home directory to be private, and if you set your <COMMAND>umask</COMMAND> to allow group read and write privileges, any member of the group can access your personal files. But mechanisms are available to prevent this access. For example, you can create a directory of private files and alter the permissions on that directory with the <COMMAND>chmod</COMMAND> command to restrict all but your own access. Then no other user would be allowed into the directory.</PARA>
<PARA>You can also use the IRIX utilities to change all the files in your home directory to your chosen permission automatically at your convenience. You can set up your account so that this action happens to any files or directories you indicate every time you log out. For example, say you have three directories, called <FILENAME>personal</FILENAME>, <FILENAME>letters</FILENAME>, and <FILENAME>budget</FILENAME>. You can set up a <FILENAME>.logout</FILENAME> file in your home directory with commands to be executed each time you log out from the system. The following commands, placed in the <FILENAME>.logout</FILENAME> file will prevent access to the three example directories to anyone but you:</PARA>
<LITERALLAYOUT>
<USERINPUT>chmod 700 budget personal letters</USERINPUT>
<USERINPUT>chmod 600 budget/* personal/* letters/*</USERINPUT>
</LITERALLAYOUT>
<PARA>The <COMMAND>umask</COMMAND> command is an important part of DAC. It allows you to maintain security and still allow convenient access to your files. To set your account up to allow group read and write privileges and no other privileges, place this line in your <FILENAME>.cshrc</FILENAME> or <FILENAME>.profile</FILENAME> file: </PARA>
<LITERALLAYOUT>
<USERINPUT>umask 006</USERINPUT>
</LITERALLAYOUT>
<PARA>This makes every file you create have the following permissions:</PARA>
<LITERALLAYOUT>
-rw-rw----
</LITERALLAYOUT>
<PARA>With your <COMMAND>umask</COMMAND> set to 006, directories that you create have the following permissions: </PARA>
<LITERALLAYOUT>
drwxrwx---
