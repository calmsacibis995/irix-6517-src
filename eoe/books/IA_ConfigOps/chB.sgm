<APPENDIX ID="LE14037-PARENT"><TITLE ID="LE14037-TITLE">Troubleshooting System Configuration Using System Error Messages</TITLE><PARA><INDEXTERM ID="ITchB-0"><PRIMARY>error messages</PRIMARY>
</INDEXTERM>
This appendix lists error messages you may receive from the IRIX operating system and offers references to appropriate areas of the documentation describing the system functions that are likely related to the error message.</PARA>
<PARA>System errors are often accompanied by several error messages that together will lead you to determining the actual problem. Read the section for each message and use your best judgement to determine which messages reflect the core problem and which are caused by the effects of the core problem on other parts of the system.</PARA>
<PARA>For error messages not covered in this guide or related IRIX Administration Guides, see the file <FILENAME>/usr/include/sys/errno.h</FILENAME>, the <COMMAND>intro(2)</COMMAND> man page, and the owner's guide for your system.</PARA>
<PARA>Some error messages are customized with specific information from your system configuration. Where this is the case, the messages listed in this appendix may contain an ellipsis (...) to indicate specific information that has been left out of the example, or the notation is made that the message you receive may be similar to the listed message, rather than an exact match.</PARA>
<SECTION><TITLE>Disk Space Messages</TITLE><PARA>The following messages deal with standard disk operations, such as messages indicating you are low on or out of available disk space.</PARA>

<SECTION  ID="LE42205-PARENT"><TITLE  ID="LE42205-TITLE">Swapping and Paging Messages</TITLE><PARA>Swapping and paging are the methods by which the operating system manages the limited memory resources in order to accommodate multiple processes and system activities. In general, the operating system keeps in actual RAM memory only those portions of the running programs that are currently or recently in use. As new sections of programs are needed, they are paged (or &ldquo;faulted&rdquo;) into memory, and as old sections are no longer needed they are paged out.</PARA>
<PARA>&ensp;Swapping is similar to paging, except that entire processes are swapped out, instead of individual memory pages, as in paging. The system maintains a section of hard disk for swapping. If this space is filled, no further programs can be swapped out, and thus no further programs can be created.</PARA>
<PARA>The following messages may indicate a swapping or paging problem:</PARA>
<LITERALLAYOUT>
Swap out failed on logical swap
