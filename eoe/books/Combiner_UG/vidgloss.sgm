Because the video level is known, this part of the signal is used for black-level clamping circuit operation. Setup is typically used in the NTSC video format and is typically not used in the PAL video format; it was originally introduced to simplify the design of early television receivers, which had trouble distinguishing between video black levels and horizontal blanking. Also called pedestal. </PARAGRAPH>
