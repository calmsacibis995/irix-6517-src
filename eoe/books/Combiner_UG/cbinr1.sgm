<PARAGRAPH>The InfiniteReality video display subsystem takes rendered images from the raster subsystem digital framebuffer and processes the pixels through digital-to-analog converters (DACs) to generate an analog pixel stream suitable for display on a high-resolution RGB video monitor. The display subsystem supports programmable pixel timings so that the system can drive displays with a wide variety of resolutions, refresh rates, and interlace/noninterlace characteristics. <INDEXTARGET ID="cbinr11"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: cbinr11|InfiniteReality graphics --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Use the Combiner only with Onyx InfiniteReality or <ITALICS>i</ITALICS>-Station graphics systems. For RealityEngine<SUPERSCRIPT>2</SUPERSCRIPT> and VTX graphics systems, you must use the video out panel or other custom applications.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The InfiniteReality hardware includes either two or eight independent video channels in the standard configuration. The second video channel serves a dual role as a standard RGB video channel or as a composite or S-Video encoder. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>For the InfiniteReality video graphics display subsystem, Silicon Graphics provides a configuration utility, the Video Format Combiner, <INDEXTARGET ID="cbinr12"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: cbinr12|Video Format Combiner. <ITALICS>See</ITALICS> Combiner --><INDEXTARGET ID="cbinr13"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: cbinr13|Combiner --><INDEXTARGET ID="cbinr14"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: cbinr14|<ITALICS>ircombine</ITALICS> --><REFPAGE>ircombine(1G)</REFPAGE>. The Combiner groups video output formats into a <INDEXTARGET ID="cbinr15"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: cbinr15|video format combination --><ITALICS>video format combination</ITALICS>&mdash;descriptions of raster sizes and timing to be used on video outputs&mdash; to validate that they operate correctly on the InfiniteReality video display subsystem hardware. The Combiner also configures the underlying graphics framebuffer and instructs the video subsystem to convert digital information stored there into a variety of video signals, or channels, ranging from high-resolution to low-resolution outputs. The output can then be displayed on additional monitors or projection devices, or stored on videotape, in any combination. Output can be genlocked to an external reference signal.</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = "Cbinr.channel"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="28151">Channel Input and Output</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>All channels derive their pixels from areas on the raster (framebuffer area). You can use the Combiner to select any area of the screen, or the contents of any window on the screen, as channel input; channels can overlap. A convenience feature allows you to click a specific window on the screen for channel input. You can also copy one channel's format to another. <INDEXTARGET ID="cbinr16"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: cbinr16|framebuffer:and raster --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>InfiniteReality's multichannel feature takes the digital, ordered pixel output from the framebuffer and allows you to specify two to eight separate rectangular areas to be sent from the rectangular framebuffer area managed by the X Window System to independent component RGB video outputs. Each video channel can have its own video timing. This capability is particularly useful for applications such as visual simulation, virtual reality, or entertainment. </PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = "Cbinr.VOFcombo"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="50597">Video Format Combinations</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>After you set up the channels, you can save them as a video format combination. You can download a video format combination into the hardware as the current video configuration, store it as the default configuration to be used at system power-on or graphics initialization, or save it in a video format combination file. You can create a combination from scratch or by modifying a current or default combination or a previously saved combination. The Combiner software includes sample combinations.<INDEXTARGET ID="cbinr17"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: cbinr17|video format combination --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Video output combinations include &ldquo;combinations&rdquo; of a single video output format. </PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = "Cbinr.SiriusV"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="77838">Option Boards</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The Onyx2 accommodates video option boards: Sirius Video, Digital Video Port (DVP), and Graphics to Video Option (GVO). These options appear as dedicated channels in the Video Format Combiner interface. </PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Sirius Video</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The Sirius Video option is available for applications that require live video input. Data from the Sirius Video board's two inputs can be blended using incoming alpha-key blending, internal chroma-key generation, or a key generated in real time from InfiniteReality graphics. <INDEXTARGET ID="cbinr18"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: cbinr18|Sirius Video --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If the Sirius Video option is installed, you can use its dedicated channel for its output. You can configure this Sirius Video channel to use a high-resolution channel as input, set it up to pass pixels through or filter them, and set other options as well. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The <DOCTITLE>Sirius Video Programming and Configuration Guide</DOCTITLE> (007-2238-003 or later) describes this option. </PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Digital Video Port (DVP) <INDEXTARGET ID="cbinr19"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: cbinr19|DVP --></TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The Digital Video Port (DVP) option board provides digital video data from the InfiniteReality framebuffer in raster-scan order, left to right, top to bottom, one pixel at a time, at the pixel clock rate. Pixel data is 36 bits wide (12 bits per RGB component). It can also access 16-bit luminance information. <INDEXTARGET ID="cbinr110"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: cbinr110|Digital Video Port. <ITALICS>See</ITALICS> DVP. --></PARAGRAPH>

GVO by itself is perfect for output of graphics to digital video in real time. This board is a daughtercard installed on a Display Generator (DG) board that has two channels only (DG5-2); the two DG5 channels remain available.</PARAGRAPH>
