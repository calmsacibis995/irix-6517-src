<PARAGRAPH>This example assumes that the Combiner main window is open. If it is not, follow the instructions at the beginning of this appendix. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>In the Combiner main window, select &ldquo;New&rdquo; from the File pulldown menu. Then click <BUTTON>OK</BUTTON> in the warning box.
