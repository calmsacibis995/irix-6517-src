<INTRODUCTION><TITLE>About This Guide</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The Video Format Combiner is a utility for the InfiniteReality video display subsystem for the Silicon Graphics Onyx or POWER Onyx deskside or rackmount graphics workstation running IRIX 6.5 or later. The display subsystem supports programmable pixel timings to allow the system to drive displays with a wide variety of resolutions, refresh rates, and interlace/noninterlace characteristics. <INDEXTARGET ID="cbinr.intro1"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: cbinr.intro1|IRIX version --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Each InfiniteReality pipe includes either two or eight video output channels. The Video Format Combiner is the utility that you use to select video output formats for the channels and to group the formats of the individual channels into a combination. You also use the Combiner to define the per-channel and global parameters of the combination.</PARAGRAPH>
