<PARAGRAPH>
The <ITALICS>pmrun</ITALICS> tool provides a graphical user interface,
in the form of the <ITALICS>Performance Co-Pilot Launch</ITALICS>
dialog, for launching Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) applications (see
the <ITALICS>PCPIntro(1)</ITALICS> manual page) from the Indigo
Magic desktop.
<ITALICS>pmrun</ITALICS> is not normally invoked directly by users. 
Rather, it is used indirectly through the PCP file type rules which are
incorporated into the desktop.
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
Most PCP applications have a list of common command line arguments
which provide a consistent interface to the many PCP command invocations.
<ITALICS>pmrun</ITALICS> has some knowledge of a number of the frequently
used arguments, and if <ITALICS>Alt</ITALICS>-double click is pressed,
it will launch a customized Performance Co-Pilot Launch dialog,
according to which arguments are accepted by a given application.
The most complex version of the Performance Co-Pilot Launch dialog
is shown in Figure 1.

The radio buttons at the top of the dialog define the metrics source -
metrics can be fetched either from a host, or from an archive.
When the <ITALICS>Host</ITALICS> radio button is chosen, a host name
can by typed or a host icon may be `dropped' into the chooser below
the radio button.
When the <ITALICS>Archive</ITALICS> radio button is chosen, a valid
PCP archive filename can be entered or a PCP archive icon may be
dropped into the chooser.
The radio buttons and chooser are only displayed if the PCP
application in question can fetch metrics from either an archive
and a host.
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
The <ITALICS>Start Time</ITALICS> and <ITALICS>End Time</ITALICS>
text boxes below the chooser can only be edited when an archive is
the metrics source.  The <ITALICS>Start Time</ITALICS> text box
accepts a time at which to start fetching metrics from the archive,
and the <ITALICS>End Time</ITALICS> text box accepts the time at
which to finish fetching metrics from the archive.
The syntax for specifying the time is described in
the <ITALICS>PCPIntro(1)</ITALICS> manual page.
The two text boxes are only displayed if the radio buttons and chooser
(mentioned above) are displayed, and the PCP application in question
accepts the <BOLD>-S</BOLD> and <BOLD>-T</BOLD> flags as
command line arguments (see the <ITALICS>PCPIntro(1)</ITALICS> manual page).
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
The <ITALICS>Command</ITALICS> text box contains the path and name
of the PCP application being launched.  This text box is not editable,
and is present in all dialogs launched by <ITALICS>pmrun</ITALICS>.
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
The <ITALICS>Arguments</ITALICS> text box may be used to propagate
command line arguments to the PCP application being launched.
This text box is editable, and is present in all dialogs launched
by <ITALICS>pmrun</ITALICS>.
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
The command, with all the selected options is invoked when either
the <ITALICS>OK</ITALICS> or the <ITALICS>Apply</ITALICS> button
is pressed.  When the <ITALICS>Apply</ITALICS> button is clicked,
the command is launched, but the dialog is not dismissed.
