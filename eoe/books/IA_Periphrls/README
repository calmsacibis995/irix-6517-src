README for the IRIX Admin: Peripheral Devices Guide

Here's the state of things:

I haven't done anything with the new MAKEDEV and device files 
strategies, or found out much about ZIP and JAZ drives. 

Most all bugs are fixed - just a couple outstanding.

I can be reached at zursch@cyberhighway.net if you have any
further questions. 

Good luck!
