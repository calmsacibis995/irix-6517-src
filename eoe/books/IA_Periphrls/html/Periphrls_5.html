<H1>About This Guide</H1>
<HR>
<P>This guide explains how to use the system-level IRIX utilities available with IRIS workstations and servers to set up and maintain peripheral devices, such as terminals, modems, printers, and CD-ROM and tape drives.<P>
<P>If you have a graphics workstation, you may find it convenient to use the System Manager, which is described in the <I><A NAME=MARKER-18-2></A>Personal System Administration Guide<A NAME=MARKER-19-4></A></I>. That guide should be your first resource for administering graphics workstations. The task managers available from the System Manager, which relate to topics covered in this document, are the Serial Device Manager for managing terminals and modems and the Printer Manager for managing printers.<P>
<P>Regardless of whether you use the System Manager or the IRIX command-line interface, the results are the same. The System Manager does not create any new files on your system, whereas applications such as IRIS WorkSpace do create new files.<P>
<P>If you do not have a graphics-capable monitor, this book and the other books in the <I>IRIX Admin</I> suite are your primary guides to system administration, because without graphics, you cannot use the System Manager. This guide does not describe the System Manager; it covers the traditional shell command approach to administering peripherals with the IRIX operating system. This guide also does not describe hardware cable connections. Refer to your <I>Owner's Guide</I> and device documentation for information on how to attach peripheral devices.<P>
