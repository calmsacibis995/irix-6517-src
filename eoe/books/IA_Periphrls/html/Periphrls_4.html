<P> <IMG SRC="bookshelf.gif"><P>
<P><A NAME=MARKER-2-1></A>This guide is part of the <I>IRIX Admin</I> manual set, which is intended for administrators: those who are responsible for servers, multiple systems, and file structures outside the user's home directory and immediate working directories. If you maintain systems for others or if you require more information about IRIX than is available in the end-user manuals, these guides are for you. The <I>IRIX Admin </I>guides are available through the IRIS InSight online viewing system. <P>
