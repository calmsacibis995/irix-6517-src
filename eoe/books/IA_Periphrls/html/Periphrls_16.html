<P>The line printer (<I>lp</I>) spooling utility is software that manages the print spooling system. Spooling is a technique that temporarily stores data until it is ready to be processed (in this case, by your printer). For <I>lp</I> spooling, a file (or group of files) to be printed is stored in a queue until a printer becomes available, as shown in <A HREF=#MARKER-9-6>Figure 2-1</A>. When the printer is available, the next file in the queue is printed. <P>

<P>
<P><I>lp</I> spooling allows background printing; users can use their workstations while their print jobs await the printer. With <I>lp</I> spooling, printers can be shared among many users. The flow of printing is regulated by the <I>lp</I> spooling utility.<P>
<P>The user interface to <I>lp</I> is a series of user and administrator commands that permit control of individual print jobs and management of printer resources.<P>

<H3> Terms</H3>
<P>Throughout this chapter, these terms represent important concepts in the <I>lp</I> spooling system:<P>
<DL>
<P><DT>printer
<P><DD> A logical name that points to an interface file, which represents a physical device, that is, the actual printer.
<P><DT>class
<P><DD> The name given to an ordered list of one or more printers. A printer may be assigned to more than one class but need not be a member of any class. <A HREF=#MARKER-9-7>Figure 2-2</A> shows printers divided into two classes: one for black-and-white printers and one for color printers.
<P><DT>destination
<P><DD> The place an <I>lp</I> request is sent to await printing. The destination may be a specific printer or a class of printers. An output request sent to a specific printer is printed only by that printer; a request sent to a class of printers is printed by the first available printer in its class. Default destinations are initially set up but can later be modified, as needed.
