<H2> <A NAME=MARKER-9-9></A>About the TTY Subsystem</H2>
<P>A series of four processes--<EM>init(1M)</EM>, <EM>getty(1M)</EM> or <EM>uugetty(1M)</EM>, <EM>login(1)</EM>, and either <EM>sh(1)</EM>, <EM>csh(1)</EM>, or <EM>ksh(1)</EM>--connect a user to the IRIX system. <I>init</I> is invoked as the last step in the boot procedure and is responsible for spawning general processes. It spawns a process for each serial line that a user may log in on, as defined by instructions in the file <I>/etc/inittab</I>. The <I>getty</I> or <I>uugetty</I> commands in <I>/etc/inittab</I> require a &lt;<I>line&gt; </I>argument, which is the name of a special file in the <I>/dev </I>directory. For a description of other arguments that may be used with <I>getty</I> and <I>uugetty</I>, see the <EM>getty(1M)</EM> and <EM>uugetty(1M)</EM> reference pages.<P>
<P>A user attempting to make a connection generates a signal that is routed by the hardware to the <I>getty</I> process (derived from "get a tty") for one of the TTY line files in <I>/dev</I>. <I>getty</I> responds by sending an entry from the file <I>/etc/gettydefs</I> down the line. The <I>gettydefs</I> entry used depends on the &lt;<I>speed&gt;</I> argument used with the <I>getty</I> command. (In the Synopsis of the <EM>getty(1M)</EM> reference page, the argument name is &lt;<I>speed&gt;</I>, but it is really a pointer to the &lt;<I>label&gt; </I>field of a <I>gettydefs</I> entry.) If no &lt;<I>speed&gt; </I>argument is provided, <I>getty</I> uses the first entry in <I>gettydefs</I>. Among the fields in the <I>gettydefs</I> entry is the login prompt (described in <A HREF=Periphrls_13.html#MARKER-9-34>"Checking Line Settings Using IRIX Shell Commands"</A>).<P>
<P>On receiving the login prompt, the user enters a login name. <I>getty</I> starts <I>login</I>, using the login name as an argument. <I>login</I> issues the prompt for a password, evaluates the user's response, and, if the password is acceptable, calls in the user's shell as listed in the <I>/etc/passwd</I> entry for the login name. If no shell is named, <I>/bin/sh</I> is furnished by default.<P>
<P><I>/bin/sh</I> executes <I>/etc/profile</I> and then executes the user's <I>.profile</I>, if it exists. <I>/bin/csh</I> executes <I>/etc/cshrc</I>, <I>.cshrc</I>, and <I>.login</I>. The <I>.profile</I>, <I>.cshrc</I>, or <I>.login</I> file often contains <I>stty</I> commands that reset terminal options that differ from the defaults. The connection between the user and the IRIX system has now been made.<P>

<H3> Terms</H3>
<P>The following terms are used to describe serial devices and the TTY system:<P>
<DL>
<P><DT>TTY 
<P><DD> The near-classic abbreviation for teletypewriter. The term covers the whole area of access between the IRIX system and peripheral serial devices, including the system console. It shows up in commands such as <I>getty</I> and <I>stty</I>, in the names of device special files such as <I>/dev/ttyd1</I>, and in the names of files such as <I>/etc/gettydefs</I>, which is used by <I>getty</I>.
<P><DT>TTY line 
<P><DD> The cable connecting the computer to the serial device.
<P><DT>port 
<P><DD> The connector on the computer where the TTY line attaches.
<P><DT>line settings 
<P><DD> A set of characteristics for data transmission over the line.
<P><DT>baud rate 
<P><DD> The speed at which data is transmitted over the line. A part of the line settings.
<P><DT>mode 
<P><DD> The characteristics of the terminal interface and a part of the line settings. The TTY line and the terminal must be working in the same mode before communication can take place. Described in <EM>termio(7)</EM>.
<P><DT>hunt sequence 
<P><DD> A series of line settings such as different baud rates. During the login sequence, a user looking for a compatible connection to the computer can go from one setting to the next by sending a BREAK signal. Also referred to as a rotary.
<P><DT>terminal options
<P><DD> <BR>Settings that define the way a given terminal operates. Described in <EM>termio(7)</EM>.
