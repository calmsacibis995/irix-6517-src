<P><DD>Requests to the printer that you are trying to use have been stopped by the <I>reject</I> command.
<P><DT><CODE>Can't access FIFO </CODE>
<P><DD>The named pipe file <I>/var/spool/lp/FIFO</I> is incorrect. The mode should be 600 with the owner lp and the group lp.
<P><DT><CODE><I>lp</I> Administrator not in password file </CODE>
<P><DD>You must have an entry in the <I>/etc/passwd</I> file for <I>lp</I>, and you must belong to the group lp.
<P><DT><CODE>destination <I>printer-name</I> unknown </CODE>
<P><DD>Use the <I>accept</I> command to enable the printer so that it can accept requests.
<P><DT><CODE>can't access file <I>xx</I></CODE>
<P><DD>The mode could be wrong on your directory or the file that you are trying to access.
<P><DT><CODE>can't create class <I>xx</I>--existing printer name </CODE>
<P><DD>The class name you are trying to use has already been given to a printer. You need to use another name or remove the printer to use the class name.
<P><DT><CODE>can't create new acceptance status file </CODE>

<P><DD>The mode on the file <I>/var/spool/lp/request/&lt;printer-name&gt;/&lt;id&gt; </I>is incorrect. <I>Printer-name</I> is the name of the printer such as dqp10, and<I> id</I> is the request identification number. The mode of the file should be 444, and the mode of the directory should be 755. The owner and the group should be lp. 
<P><DT><CODE>can't fork </CODE>
<P><DD>Either you have several processes running and are not allowed to run any more, or the system has all the processes running that it can handle. You must rerun this command later.
<P><DT><CODE>can't lock acceptance status </CODE>
<P><DD>The file <I>/var/spool/lp/QSTATLOCK</I> prevents more than one<I> lp </I>request from being taken at any one time. You must rerun this command later.
<P><DT><CODE>can't lock output queue </CODE>
<P><DD>The file <I>/var/spool/lp/QSTATLOCK</I> prevents more than one <I>lp</I> request from being printed on a printer at a time. You must rerun this command later.
<P><DT><CODE>can't lock printer status </CODE>
<P><DD>The temporary file <I>/var/spool/lp/PSTATLOCK </I>prevents more than one lp request from being printed on a printer at a time. You must rerun this command later.
<P><DT><CODE>can't lock sequence number file </CODE>
<P><DD>The file <I>/var/spool/lp/SEQLOCK</I> prevents more than one <I>lp</I> request from getting the next <I>printer-id</I> (request identification) number at one time. You must rerun this command later.
<P><DT><CODE>can't move request <I>printer-id</I> </CODE>
<P><DD><I>Printer-id</I> is the request identification number that cannot be moved. You will probably have to change the modes on the files and directories in <I>/var/spool/lp/request</I>. Also, after you shut down the <I>lp</I> scheduler, you must manually move the request from the disabled printer directory to the new destination.

<P><DT><CODE>can't open class file </CODE>
<P><DD>The <I>lp</I> program is trying to access the list of classes for printers. One reason it may not be able to open the class file is that the system might have the maximum number of files open that are allowed at any one time. You can correct this by typing the command at a later time.
<P><DT><CODE>can't open member file </CODE>
<P><DD>The <I>lp</I> program is trying to access the list of members in the directory <I>/var/spool/lp/member</I>. The system could have the maximum number of files open that are allowed at any one time. You can correct this by typing the command at a later time.
<P><DT><CODE>can't open <I>xx</I> file in MEMBER directory </CODE>
<P><DD>There are a number of reasons why file <I>xx</I> in the <I>/var/spool/lp/member</I> directory cannot be opened. The mode on the file could be incorrect; it should be 644. The system could have the maximum number of files open that are allowed at any time; you can correct this by typing the command at a later time.
<P><DT><CODE>can't open <I>xx</I> file in class directory </CODE>
<P><DD>If file xx cannot be opened, it is possible that the mode on the file or directory is incorrect. The file mode should be 644, and the directory mode should be 755. Another possibility is that the system has the maximum number of files open that are allowed at any one time. The latter problem can be corrected by typing the command at a later time.
<P><DT><CODE>can't open <I>xx</I> </CODE>
<P><DD>You cannot print on printer <I>xx</I> because the mode is incorrect on the <I>/dev/tty</I> file. The mode should be 622.
<P><DT><CODE>can't open FIFO </CODE>
<P><DD>The mode on the named pipe file <I>/var/spool/lp/FIFO </I>may be incorrect. It should be 600. Or the system could have the maximum number of files open that are allowed at any one time. You can correct the latter problem by typing the command at a later time.

<P><DT><CODE>can't open MEMBER directory </CODE>
<P><DD>The mode on the directory <I>/var/spool/lp/member</I> could be incorrect. It should be 755. Another possibility is that the system could have the maximum number of files open that are allowed at any one time. If this is the case, try typing the command at a later time.
<P><DT><CODE>can't open acceptance status file </CODE>
<P><DD>The mode on the file <I>/var/spool/lp/qstatus</I> may not be correct; it should be 644. Another possibility is that the system could have the maximum number of files open that are allowed at any one time. You can correct the latter problem by typing the command at a later time.
<P><DT><CODE>can't open default destination file </CODE>
<P><DD>Check the mode on the file <I>/var/spool/lp/default</I>; it should be 644. If the mode is correct, it could be that the system has the maximum number of files open that are allowed at any one time. You can correct this by trying the command at a later time.
<P><DT><CODE>can't open file <I>file</I></CODE>
<P><DD>You incorrectly typed the filename, or you do not have the correct modes set. If you are the owner, the mode should be at least 400.
<P><DT><CODE>can't open output queue </CODE>
<P><DD>Check the mode on the file /var/spool/lp/outputq; it should be 644. This error message could also be generated if the system has the maximum number of files open that are allowed at any one time. Try entering the command at a later time.
<P><DT><CODE>can't open printer status file </CODE>
<P><DD>The mode on the file <I>/var/spool/lp/pstatus </I>is incorrect; it should be 644. This message is also generated if the system has the maximum number of files open that are allowed at any one time. You can correct this by trying the command at a later time.
<P><DT><CODE>can't open request directory </CODE>
<P><DD>The mode on the directory <I>/var/spool/lp/request</I> is incorrect; it should be 655. The system may also have the maximum number of files open that are allowed at any one time. You can correct this by trying the command at a later time.
<P><DT><CODE>can't open request file <I>xx</I> </CODE>
<P><DD>The mode on the file <I>/var/spool/lp/member/request/&lt;xx&gt; </I>is incorrect. The mode should be 644. The system may also have the maximum number of files open that are allowed at any one time. You can correct this by trying the <I>lpmove</I> command at a later time.
<P><DT><CODE>can't open system default destination file </CODE>
<P><DD>The mode on the file <I>/var/spool/lp/default</I> is incorrect. The mode should be 644. The system may also have the maximum number of files open that are allowed at any one time. You can correct this by trying the command again at a later time.
<P><DT><CODE>can't open temporary output queue </CODE>
<P><DD>The mode on the file <I>/var/spool/lp/outputq</I> is incorrect. The mode should be 644. The system may also have the maximum number of files open that are allowed at any one time. You can correct this by trying the command at a later time.
<P><DT><CODE>can't proceed--scheduler running </CODE>
<P><DD>Many of the <I>lpadmin</I> command options cannot be executed while the scheduler is running. Stop the scheduler using the <I>lpshut</I> command and then try invoking the command again.
<P><DT><CODE>can't read current directory </CODE>
<P><DD>The <I>lp</I> and <I>lpadmin</I> commands cannot read the directory containing the file to be printed. The directory name may be incorrect, or you do not have read permission on that directory.
<P><DT><CODE>can't remove class file </CODE>
<P><DD>The mode may be wrong on the file <I>/var/spool/lp/class</I>. It should be 755. The owner and the group should be lp. The file in that directory may also have the wrong mode; it should be 644.
<P><DT><CODE>can't remove printer </CODE>
<P><DD>The mode may be wrong on the <I>/var/spool/lp/member</I> directory. It should be 755, and the files in that directory should be 644. Both the directory and the files should be owned by lp and the group should be lp.
<P><DT><CODE>can't remove request directory </CODE>
<P><DD>The mode may be wrong on the <I>/var/spool/lp/request</I> directory. It should be 755 and should be owned by lp, and the group should be lp. The directory may still have pending requests to be printed, which must be removed before the directory can be removed.
<P><DT><CODE>can't set user id to lp Administrator's user id </CODE>
<P><DD>The <I>lpsched </I>and <I>lpadmin</I> commands can be used only when you are logged in as lp or root.
<P><DT><CODE>can't unlink old output queue </CODE>
<P><DD>The <I>lpsched</I> program cannot remove the old output queue. You must remove it manually by using the command
<P><DD><CODE><B>rm /var/spool/lp/outputq</B></CODE> 
<P><DT><CODE>can't write to <I>xx</I></CODE>
<P><DD>The <I>lpadmin</I> command cannot write to device <I>xx</I>. The mode is probably wrong on the <I>/dev/ttyxx</I> or <I>/dev/plp</I> file. It should be 622 and owned by lp.
<P><DT><CODE>cannot create temp file filename</CODE>
<P><DD>The system may be out of free space on the <I>/var</I> filesystem. Use the command
<P><DD><CODE><B>df /var</B></CODE> 
<P><DD>to determine the number of free blocks. Several hundred blocks are required to ensure that the system performs correctly.
<P><DT><CODE>class <I>xx</I> has disappeared!</CODE>
<P><DD>Class <I>xx</I> was probably removed after the scheduler was started. The system may be out of free space on the <I>/var</I> filesystem. To find out, use the following command:
<P><DD><CODE><B>df /var</B></CODE> 
<P><DD>Use the <I>lpshut </I>command to stop the scheduler and restore the class from a backup.

<P><DT><CODE>class <I>xx</I> non-existent</CODE>
<P><DD>The class <I>xx</I> may have been removed because the system is out of free space on the <I>/var</I> filesystem. To find out how much free space is available, use the following command:
<P><DD><CODE><B>df /var</B></CODE>
<P><DD>The class will probably have to be restored from a backup.
<P><DT><CODE>class directory has disappeared! </CODE>
<P><DD>The <I>/var/spool/lp/class</I> directory has been removed. The system may be out of free space on <I>/var</I>; use the<I> <CODE><B>df /var<EM> </EM></B></CODE></I>command to find out. The class directory contains all the data for each printer class. To restore this directory, get these files and directory from a backup.
<P><DT><CODE>corrupted member file </CODE>
<P><DD>The <I>/var/spool/lp/member</I> directory has a corrupted file in it. You should restore the directory from backup.
<P><DT><CODE>default destination <I>dest</I> non-existent</CODE>
<P><DD>Either the default destination is not assigned, or the printer <I>dest</I> has been removed. Use the <I>lpadmin</I> command to set up a default destination or set your LPDEST environment variable to the value of the destination.
<P><DT><CODE>destination <I>dest</I> has disappeared! </CODE>
<P><DD>A destination printer, <I>dest</I>, has been removed after <I>lpsched</I> was started. Use the <I>lpadmin</I> command to remove the printer.
<P><DT><CODE>destination printer no longer accepting requests </CODE>
<P><DD>The printer has been disabled using the <I>reject</I> command. Use the <EM>accept</EM> command to reenable the printer.
<P><DT><CODE>destination <I>dest</I> non-existent </CODE>
<P><DD>The destination printer you specified as an argument to the <I>accept</I> or <I>lpadmin</I> command is not a valid destination name, or it was removed after the scheduler was started.
<P><DT><CODE>destination printer was already accepting requests </CODE>
<P><DD>The destination printer was previously enabled. Once a printer is accepting requests, any further <I>accept</I> commands are ignored.
<P><DT><CODE>destination printer already not accepting requests </CODE>
<P><DD>A <I>reject</I> command had already been sent to the printer. Use the <I>accept</I> command to allow the printer to start accepting requests again.
<P><DT><CODE>destination <I>printer-name</I> is not accepting requests - move in progress ... </CODE>
<P><DD>The printer has been disabled by the <I>reject</I> command, and requests are being moved from the disabled printer to another printer. The printer can be enabled again by the <I>accept</I> command.
<P><DT><CODE>destinations are identical </CODE>
<P><DD>When using the <I>lpmove</I> command, you need to specify a printer to move the print requests from and a different printer to move the requests to.
<P><DT><CODE>disabled by scheduler: login terminal </CODE>
<P><DD>The login terminal has been disabled by the <I>lp</I> scheduler. Use the <I>enable</I> command to reenable the printer.
<P><DT><CODE>error in printer request <I>printer-id</I></CODE>
<P><DD><I>Printer-id</I> is the actual request identification number. An error has likely occurred in the printer. Check the printer and reset it if needed.
<P><DT><CODE>illegal keyletter <I>xx</I> </CODE>
<P><DD>An invalid option, <I>xx</I>, was used. See the reference page for the correct options.
<P><DT><CODE>keyletters -<I>xx</I> and -<I>yy</I> are contradictory</CODE>
<P><DD>This combination of options to the <I>lpadmin</I> program cannot be used together.
<P><DT><CODE>keyletter <I>xx</I> requires a value</CODE>
<P><DD>The option <I>xx</I> requires an argument. For example, in the command line
<P><DD><CODE><B>lpadmin -m model</B></CODE> 
<P><DD>the argument to the <B>-m</B> option is the name of a model interface program.
<P><DT><CODE>keyletters -e, -i, and -m are mutually exclusive </CODE>
<P><DD>These options to the <I>lpadmin</I> command cannot be used together. Refer to the <EM>lpadmin(1M)</EM> reference page for information on usage.
<P><DT><CODE>lp: <I>xx</I></CODE>
<P><DD>In this message the variable <I>xx</I> could be one of several arguments. Typically, it is telling you that the default destination is not assigned.
<P><DT><CODE>member directory has disappeared! </CODE>
<P><DD>The <I>/var/spool/lp/member </I>directory has been removed. The system is probably out of free disk space in the <I>/var</I> filesystem. You need to clean up the <I>/var</I> filesystem and then install the <I>lp</I> commands or retrieve them from a backup.
<P><DT><CODE>model <I>xx</I> non-existent</CODE>
<P><DD>The name that you are using for a model interface program is not valid. A list of valid models is in the <I>/var/spool/lp/model</I> directory.
<P><DT><CODE>new printers require -v and either -e, -i, or -m </CODE>
<P><DD>A printer must have an interface program, which is specified by <B>-e</B>, <B>-i</B>, or <B>-m </B>options. The<B> -v</B> option specifies the device file for the printer. For more information on these options, refer to the <EM>lpadmin(1M)</EM> reference page.
<P><DT><CODE>no destinations specified </CODE>
<P><DD>There are no destination printers specified. Use the <I>lpadmin</I> command to set one up.
<P><DT><CODE>no printers specified </CODE>
<P><DD>There are no printers specified. Use the <I>lpadmin</I> command to set one up.
<P><DT><CODE>non-existent printer <I>xx</I> in PSTATUS </CODE>
<P><DD>A printer with the name <I>xx</I> is in the <I>/var/spool/lp/pstatus</I> file but no longer exists. Use the <I>lpadmin</I> command to remove the printer.
<P><DT><CODE>non-existent printer <I>printer-name</I> in class <I>xx</I></CODE>
<P><DD>The printer that you are trying to address in class <I>xx</I> has been removed from that class.
<P><DT><CODE>out of memory </CODE>
<P><DD>The message states that there is not enough memory to contain the text to be printed.
<P><DT><CODE>printer <I>printer-name</I> already in class <I>xx</I></CODE>
<P><DD>The printer you are trying to move to class <I>xx</I> is already in that class. You cannot move a printer to a class that it is already in.
<P><DT><CODE>printer <I>printer-name</I> has disappeared!</CODE>
<P><DD>The printer has been removed, and the <I>enable</I> command cannot find it. The printer was most likely removed after the workstation was rebooted or after the scheduler was started.
<P><DT><CODE>printer <I>printer-name</I> non-existent</CODE>
<P><DD><I>Printer-name</I> is the name of a printer that was removed after the scheduler was started. You must use the command
<P><DD><CODE><B>lpadmin -x<I>printer-name</I></B></CODE> 
<P><DT><CODE>printer status entry for printer has disappeared</CODE>
<P><DD>The <I>/var/spool/lp/pstatus </I>file has been corrupted. You need to resubmit the printer request.
<P><DT><CODE>printer <I>printer-name</I> was not busy</CODE>
<P><DD>The printer is not printing a request at this time. Either the request you wanted to cancel is finished printing or you have specified the wrong printer.
<P><DT><CODE>request <I>printer-id</I> non-existent</CODE>
<P><DD>You are attempting to cancel a request that does not exist. You may have given the wrong printer name or wrong request ID number, or the request may have finished printing.
<P><DT><CODE>request not accepted </CODE>
<P><DD>The request was not accepted by <I>lp</I>. The scheduler may not be running. Use the <I>lpstat -t</I> command to find out more information.
<P><DT><CODE>requests still queued for<I> printer-name</I>--use lpmove </CODE>
<P><DD><I>Printer-name</I> is a printer that still has requests waiting to be printed. Use the <I>lpmove</I> command to move those requests to another printer.
<P><DT><CODE>scheduler is still running--can't proceed </CODE>
<P><DD>You cannot perform this command while the scheduler is running. Use the <I>lpshut</I> command first.
<P><DT><CODE>spool directory non-existent </CODE>
<P><DD>The directory <I>/var/spool </I>has been removed. Use the <I>mkdir</I> command to restore the directory. This has probably removed some of the necessary <I>lp</I> files. You may have to reinstall the <I>lp</I> commands.
<P><DT><CODE>standard input is empty </CODE>
<P><DD>You specified an invalid filename either by incorrectly typing a name or by specifying a nonexistent file. Nothing will be printed from this request.
<P><DT><CODE>this command for use only by lp Administrators </CODE>
<P><DD>This command is restricted to someone logged in as root or lp.
<P><DT><CODE>too many options for interface program </CODE>
<P><DD>The <I>lp</I> command called the appropriate interface program with too many arguments. For more information on the options and arguments that can be used with the <I>lp</I> command, refer to the <EM>lp(1)</EM> reference page.
