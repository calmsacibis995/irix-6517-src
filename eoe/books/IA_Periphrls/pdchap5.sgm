<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Hardware Troubleshooting Checklist</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Use the following list of questions to determine whether your printer hardware is working as designed:</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Is the printer turned on?</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Printers do not always indicate clearly whether they are turned on. Make sure the printer is plugged into the power socket and the power switch is on. </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Does the printer have paper?</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Frequently, printers run out of paper in a high-volume situation. </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Is there a paper jam?</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Make sure the entire paper pathway is clear of sheets or fragments of paper. Refer to your printer hardware documentation before attempting to put any unusual paper or other media through your printer. </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Is the printer set to the correct baud? </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Be sure the baud rate of the printer matches that of the serial port. </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Is the serial cable attached correctly?</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Often, reseating the serial cable where it connects to the printer restores correct operation.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Is the correct cable being used?</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The use of the pins in serial cables varies somewhat in different applications. Cables designed for specific hardware may or may not function correctly with different hardware. Check your system <DOCTITLE>Owner's Guide</DOCTITLE> and the documentation supplied with your printer and cable to determine whether the cable is correct for your hardware.</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>If <COMMAND>hinv</COMMAND> does not report an attached tape drive, then your operating system cannot use the drive. You need to check the installation of the hardware. What you can do at this time depends on your maintenance support agreements.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Simple hardware checks are</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>If the tape drive is an external unit, does it have power? Simply powering it on does not cause it to be seen by the computer. The system must be shut down, power cycled, then rebooted.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>During the boot phase, does the access light on the tape drive light up? If it does not flash at all, chances are the operating system is still not seeing the drive.</PARAGRAPH>

<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Is the SCSI cabling and termination correct? If visual inspection shows nothing obvious, try resetting the connectors. Any movement of hardware or cabling must be done with the system powered off.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>If none of the above causes <COMMAND>hinv</COMMAND> to report the tape drive, then the most likely problem is faulty hardware. Contact your support provider.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="36590">Checking the Software</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>If you are reasonably sure the tape drive is correctly installed on the computer, but your software does not seem to be able to use it, the tape device's SCSI address may have changed when other SCSI devices were added to your system. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The system assumes that if <FILENAME>/dev/nrtape</FILENAME> exists and appears to be a tape drive of some kind, then it does not need to remake the default tape drive links of <FILENAME>/dev/tape</FILENAME>, <FILENAME>/dev/nrtape</FILENAME>, and so on. It also assumes that the first tape drive that it finds is the main tape drive. It searches for devices starting at the highest SCSI ID numbers, so the tape device on SCSI&nbsp;ID 7 gets the default links before a tape device on SCSI ID 3.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The default tape drive for most commands is <FILENAME>/dev/tape</FILENAME>. If the tape drive installation proceeded correctly, you should have at least <FILENAME>/dev/tape</FILENAME> and <FILENAME>/dev/nrtape</FILENAME> special device files. You may have several others, depending on the type of tape drive. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The <COMMAND>mt</COMMAND> command can be used to confirm that <FILENAME>/dev/tape</FILENAME> exists and that the tape drive is responding. Output similar to the following from the <COMMAND>mt status</COMMAND> command confirms that</PARAGRAPH>
<CODE>
Controller: SCSI
Device: ARCHIVE: Python 25601-XXX2.63
Status: 0x20262
Drive type: DAT
Media : READY, writable, at BOT
</CODE>
<PARAGRAPH>The following output means that you have another process accessing the drive right now:</PARAGRAPH>

/dev/nrtape: Device or resource busy
</CODE>
<PARAGRAPH>The following output appears when a special device file does not exist:</PARAGRAPH>
<CODE>
/dev/nrtape: No such file or directory
</CODE>
<PARAGRAPH>The output when a device file exists, but no hardware is responding at that address, is</PARAGRAPH>
<CODE>
/dev/nrtape: No such device

</CODE>
<PARAGRAPH>In this example the device unit number is 3 (this is likely to be different on your system).
