<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>lpmove: Move a Request to Another Printer </TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The <COMMAND>lpmove<INDEXTARGET ID="pdchap214"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: pdchap214|<ITALICS>lpmove</ITALICS> --></COMMAND> command moves print requests from one destination to another. For example, if you have a printer removed for repairs, you may want to move all jobs pending on the queue to a destination with a working printer. You may also use <COMMAND>lpmove</COMMAND> to move specific requests from one destination to another but only after you have halted the scheduler with the <COMMAND>lpshut</COMMAND> command. <COMMAND>lpmove</COMMAND> automatically rejects job requests rerouted to a destination without a printer. The <COMMAND>lpmove</COMMAND> command takes two forms:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
<USERINPUT>/usr/lib/lpmove</USERINPUT>&space;<VARIABLE>dest1</VARIABLE>&space;<VARIABLE>dest2</VARIABLE>&space;
<USERINPUT>/usr/lib/lpmove</USERINPUT>&space;<VARIABLE>request(s)</VARIABLE>&space;<VARIABLE>destination</VARIABLE>&space;
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH><VARIABLE>dest1</VARIABLE>, <VARIABLE>dest2</VARIABLE>, and <VARIABLE>destination</VARIABLE> are printers or classes of printers. <VARIABLE>request</VARIABLE> is a specific request&nbsp;ID.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>In the first form of the command, all requests are moved from <VARIABLE>dest1</VARIABLE> to <VARIABLE>dest2</VARIABLE>. After the move, the printer or printers at <VARIABLE>dest1</VARIABLE> does not accept requests until you issue an accept command. All rerouted requests are renamed <VARIABLE>dest2-nnn</VARIABLE>, where <VARIABLE>nnn</VARIABLE> is a new sequence number in the queue for destination <VARIABLE>dest2</VARIABLE>. In the second form, which you can issue only after you stop the scheduler, the rerouted requests are renamed <VARIABLE>destination</VARIABLE>-<VARIABLE>nnn</VARIABLE>. When you restart the scheduler, the original destinations still accept new requests. <XREF IDREF="38003" TYPE="TEXT">Example&nbsp;2-7</XREF> demonstrates the use of the <COMMAND>lpmove</COMMAND> and <COMMAND>lpshut</COMMAND> commands.</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>The special file <FILENAME>/dev/plp</FILENAME> is the interface to the parallel printer port. Some larger servers have multiple parallel ports. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If you have more than one parallel port on your system, the device files that refer to the ports are named according to the board slot in which the CPU board is installed. For example, if you have an IO4 board in slot 2 and another in slot 4, the device files for the parallel ports are <FILENAME>/dev/plp2</FILENAME> and <FILENAME>/dev/plp4</FILENAME>. One of these devices (the parallel port attached to the board designated as the primary board) is linked to the default <FILENAME>/dev/plp</FILENAME>.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Normally, <FILENAME>/dev/plp</FILENAME> is directly accessed only by a print spooling mechanism such as the <COMMAND>lp</COMMAND> subsystem. The special file <FILENAME>/dev/plp</FILENAME> may only be opened for writing one process at a time. However, several processes may open the device in read-only mode to find out the printer status. A printer reset is issued whenever the device file is opened for writing. For a complete description of the parallel printer interface, see the <REFPAGE>plp(7)</REFPAGE> reference page.</PARAGRAPH>

If this is not the first name in the name field, you need to do one of two things:</PARAGRAPH>
