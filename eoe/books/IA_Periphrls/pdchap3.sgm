<PARAGRAPH>The <COMMAND>mediad</COMMAND> daemon monitors the removable media devices on a system. When media is inserted, <COMMAND>mediad</COMMAND> scans the media for filesystems and mounts them.

<NOTE><PREFIX>Note</PREFIX>Only one instance of <COMMAND>mediad</COMMAND> is allowed per system. That is, two invocations of <COMMAND>mediad</COMMAND> for the same device generate an error.</NOTE>

<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>CD-ROM Filesystems</TITLE><PARAGRAPH><COMMAND>mediad</COMMAND> monitors CD-ROM drives, waiting for a CD-ROM to be inserted. When a CD-ROM is inserted, the filesystem it contains is mounted if the filesystem is in EFS, HFS, ISO 9660, or High Sierra format. When a CD-ROM containing a valid filesystem is inserted, it is automatically mounted on <FILENAME>/CDROM</FILENAME> (for the first CD-ROM drive) and <FILENAME>/CDROM2</FILENAME>, <FILENAME>/CDROM3</FILENAME>, and so on for additional drives. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Note that CD-ROM filesystems are always read-only. When you are finished using the filesystem, issue the <COMMAND>eject</COMMAND> command and <COMMAND>mediad</COMMAND> will attempt to unmount the filesystem. If the unmount is successful, it ejects the CD-ROM. When <COMMAND>mediad</COMMAND> is running, however, any user can unmount and eject a CD-ROM with the <COMMAND>eject</COMMAND> command.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Floppy Disk Filesystems</TITLE><NOTE><PREFIX>Note</PREFIX>In this chapter, the term <ITALICS>floppy disk drive</ITALICS> also applies to a floptical drive because both are configured and used in the same manner. </NOTE>
<PARAGRAPH>Filesystems on floppy disk drives are controlled by the <COMMAND>mediad</COMMAND> daemon. <COMMAND>mediad</COMMAND> scans the hardware inventory for devices it knows about and automatically begins monitoring them, waiting for a disk to be inserted. Floppy disk drives are mounted on <FILENAME>/floppy</FILENAME> if the disk is in FAT (MS-DOS) or HFS (Macintosh) format. If you have more than one floppy disk drive, floppy disks in additional drives are automatically mounted on <FILENAME>/floppy2</FILENAME>, <FILENAME>/floppy3</FILENAME>, and so on.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>To prevent <COMMAND>mediad</COMMAND> from monitoring a device, put a command like this in the file <FILENAME>/etc/config/mediad.config</FILENAME>: </PARAGRAPH>
<CODE>
ignore device /dev/scsi/sc0d4l0 
</CODE>
<PARAGRAPH>For complete details, refer to the <REFPAGE>mediad(1M)</REFPAGE> reference page.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>When you are through using the floppy disk, issue the eject command and <COMMAND>mediad</COMMAND> attempts to unmount the filesystem. If the unmount is successful, it ejects the floppy disk immediately.</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="34177">Configuring Floppy Disk Drive Device Files</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>There are a number of SCSI floppy disk drives available for use with your system. To install a floppy disk drive on an IRIX system, follow the hardware documentation that is furnished with your drive to connect it to the computer. <INDEXTARGET ID="pdchap37"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: pdchap37|tape:adding a drive --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If you are adding a floppy disk drive to a system that does not have one, the software configuration is taken care of automatically when the system boots. When the system boots, if <COMMAND>hinv</COMMAND> indicates that a floppy disk drive is installed but that there is no link to it through the <FILENAME>/dev</FILENAME> special device files, the <COMMAND>MAKEDEV</COMMAND> program is automatically invoked to add the proper device files.

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="24017">Using Floppy Disk Drives</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>This section describes how to copy files to and retrieve files from floppy and floptical disks, regardless of whether the disk is in Macintosh, DOS, or IRIX filesystem format. </PARAGRAPH>
<NOTE><PREFIX>Note</PREFIX>The term <ITALICS>floppy disk</ITALICS> is used interchangeably with <ITALICS>floptical disk</ITALICS> in this section.</NOTE>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Using DOS and Macintosh Floppy Disks</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The <COMMAND>mediad</COMMAND> daemon automatically determines the format of a floppy disk inserted in your drive and, if it is a DOS or Macintosh floppy disk, automatically mounts the filesystem on your default mount directory. Once the filesystem is mounted, you can use typical IRIX commands such as <COMMAND>cd</COMMAND>, <COMMAND>ls</COMMAND>, and <COMMAND>pwd</COMMAND> with it. See the <REFPAGE>mediad(1M)</REFPAGE> reference page for complete information.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Using a Floppy Disk Drive for IRIX File Transfer</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>You can use a floppy disk drive like a tape drive for IRIX file transfer. Use the standard tape archive commands to write files to the floppy disk if the disk is formatted.  Use the <COMMAND>mkfp</COMMAND> command to format an unformatted floppy.  See the <REFPAGE>mkfp(1M)</REFPAGE> reference page for additional information.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>When you place files on a floppy disk, make a note on the disk label of the format or the exact command used to place the files on the floppy disk. This makes it easy for you (and others) to retrieve the files from the floppy disk. Also, whenever possible, change directories to the directory that contains the file and place the file on the floppy disk using a relative pathname, rather than specifying the absolute pathname. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Also be aware that using a floppy disk to transfer files to systems made by other manufacturers may mean that the same tools are not available on the receiving system. The <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND>, <COMMAND>cpio</COMMAND>, and <COMMAND>dd</COMMAND> tools are usually available on all UNIX systems. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>In the following examples, the floppy disk drive device name is given as <FILENAME>/dev/rdsk/fds0d3.3.5</FILENAME>. Your actual device name may be different. </PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Floppy Disk File Transfer With tar</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>To place a copy of the file <FILENAME>transfer.file</FILENAME> on a floppy disk with the <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND> command, use the syntax</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
<USERINPUT>tar cvf /dev/rdsk/fds0d3.3.5 transfer.file</USERINPUT>&space;
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>To retrieve the file, use the command</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
<USERINPUT>tar xvf /dev/rdsk/fds0d3.3.5 transfer.file</USERINPUT>&space;
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>To retrieve all files from a <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND> floppy disk, use the command</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
<USERINPUT>tar xvf /dev/rdsk/fds0d3.3.5</USERINPUT>&space;
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>or for high-density floppy disks</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Floppy Disk File Transfer With cpio</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>To copy files to floppy disk with <COMMAND>cpio</COMMAND>, use the command</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
<USERINPUT>ls transfer.file | cpio -oc > /dev/rdsk/fds0d3.3.5</USERINPUT>&space;

<PARAGRAPH>To retrieve the file again, use the command</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>The following command extracts the same file</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH><USERINPUT>dd if=/dev/rdsk/fds0d3.3.5</USERINPUT>&space;<USERINPUT>of=transfer.file conv=sync</USERINPUT>&space;</PARAGRAPH>
<NOTE><PREFIX>Note</PREFIX><COMMAND>dd</COMMAND> works only with single files. You can use <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND> or <COMMAND>cpio</COMMAND> to create an archive file, though, and then use <COMMAND>dd</COMMAND> to transfer that archive. If you attempt to extract the file on another brand of workstation and experience an error, try adding the <COMMAND>conv=swab</COMMAND> statement to your extraction command line.
