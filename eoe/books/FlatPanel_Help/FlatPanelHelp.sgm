You may also choose to color calibrate your panel; if so, please do so before choosing settings for gamma, color temperature, or intensity.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The control panel allows you to choose these settings from one of the existing preset configurations. If you wish, you can edit any existing preset configuration or create a new one by changing the current values and clicking <BUTTON>Apply</BUTTON>.</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = "calibrate_monitor"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="47580">Color Calibrating Your Monitor</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>To display your preset configuration more accurately, your Silicon Graphics 1600SW flat panel comes with an integrated color calibration system. While this step is optional, it will configure your panel more closely to the settings you have chosen in your preset configuration. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>To use this feature, please follow these steps:</PARAGRAPH>
<ORDEREDLIST><LIST><PARAGRAPH>Determine your desired preset configuration (see <XREF IDREF="63655" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Creating Presets&rdquo;</XREF>) and click <BUTTON>Apply</BUTTON>.</PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>Click <BUTTON>Calibrate</BUTTON>.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>A new calibration window will appear in the center of your screen. Do not move it.</PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>Attach your Gamma Sensor to the flat panel following the instructions and diagrams provided in the <DOCTITLE>O2 Workstations: Flat Panel Monitor Adapter Installation Guide</DOCTITLE>. Please be certain that the rounded end of the Gamma Sensor sits over the calibration window.</PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>Click <BUTTON>OK</BUTTON> to begin the automated procedure. Diagnostic messages will appear as the cycle progresses.</PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>To stop the calibration cycle, click <BUTTON>Cancel</BUTTON> at any time.</PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>The calibration window will disappear once the cycle completes. You may remove the Gamma Sensor.</PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
</ORDEREDLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>Your panel is now calibrated. Depending on the amount you use the panel, you may need to recalibrate to maintain color accuracy. For the average user, we recommend every 1 to 2 months. </PARAGRAPH>
<NOTE><PREFIX>Note</PREFIX>To ensure that preset configurations are loaded each time a user begins an Xsession, all color managed user accounts should have the following line added to the <FILENAME>$HOME/.sgisession</FILENAME> file:</NOTE>
<EXAMPLE>
/usr/sbin/flatpanel -nogui
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>Upon logging into an account configured in this manner, your last active preset configuration will automatically be loaded for your system. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Without such a change, you will need to run the Silicon Graphics 1600SW Settings control panel each time you begin a new Xsession. In a multiuser environment, such a change is mandatory if each user wishes to use the flat panel calibrated to his or her own liking. Additionally, each user should perform a calibration of the panel, particularly if the room lighting or other workarea conditions differ between users. Calibration data is stored in the file</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
$HOME/.desktop-[<VARIABLE>hostname</VARIABLE>]/fp1600sw
</EXAMPLE>
<TIP><PREFIX>Tip</PREFIX>Keep in mind that you should always use the Screen Saver program with the Power Saver option selected to prolong the life of your backlights (and, in turn, reduce the need for frequent recalibration with the Gamma Sensor).</TIP>
<NOTE><PREFIX>Note</PREFIX>The login screen saver is not affected by the Screen Saver settings of any user including <COMMAND>root</COMMAND>. We recommend that you edit the file</NOTE>

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = "config_gamma"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="60601">Configuring Gamma Settings</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The gamma of a display describes the relationship between the video input signal level and the light output or intensity displayed on the flat panel. The Silicon Graphics 1600SW flat panel has an uncorrected gamma value of 1.8. Based on your work environment and how you use your display, you may want to choose a different gamma value. This gamma setting can be varied from 1.0 to 3.0.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>To change the gamma setting, enter your preferred value in the gamma text field, then click the <BUTTON>Apply</BUTTON> button. This will cause your new gamma value to take effect immediately, and it will automatically save your current preset configuration with this new value.</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = "config_colortemp"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="51184">Configuring Color Temperature</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Color temperature refers to the definition of your panel's white point. The definition of the color white is not absolute, and may exist somewhere in color space from red-white to blue-white. You may adjust the white point within this red-blue range.</PARAGRAPH>
<NOTE><PREFIX>Note</PREFIX>The Silicon Graphics 1600SW Settings application automatically searches for the brightest intensity setting when color temperature is adjusted. As a result, the intensity slider will jump to full value after a color temperature change. We recommend that you first adjust the color temperature and then adjust the intensity for your monitor.</NOTE>
<PARAGRAPH>The range for defining color temperature is described in degrees Kelvin, with red at the low end and blue at the high end.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The slider which controls color temperature is dynamic, and will update your display immediately, but will not be saved to your preset configuration until you click <BUTTON>Apply</BUTTON>.</PARAGRAPH>
<NOTE><PREFIX>Note</PREFIX>The Silicon Graphics 1600SW Flat Panel white point adjustment is performed using backlighting only. Unlike a typical CRT monitor, no dynamic range is lost in the colors your panel is able to display.</NOTE>
