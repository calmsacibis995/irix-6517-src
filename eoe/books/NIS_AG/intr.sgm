<INTRODUCTION><TITLE>About This Guide</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The <ITALICS>NIS Administrator's Guide</ITALICS> documents the SGI implementation of the network information service NIS.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>NIS is a database service that provides location information about network entities to other network services, such as NFS. Systems with heterogeneous architectures and operating systems can participate in the same NIS. The service can also include systems connected to different types of networks.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>This guide was formerly published under the title <DOCTITLE>NFS and NIS Administration Guide and Man Pages</DOCTITLE>, and documented the Network File System (NFS), as well as NIS. You can find information about NFS in a separate volume titled <DOCTITLE>ONC3/NFS Administrator's Guide</DOCTITLE>.</PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Using This Guide</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>This guide provides information you need to set up and maintain NIS. It explains the software fundamentals of the product and provides procedures to help you install, test, and troubleshoot NIS on your network. It also contains recommendations for planning and administering NIS.</PARAGRAPH>
