<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>&lbreak;Be sure the capacity of the medium you have selected is adequate for the network size and data transmission type (large or small volumes of data, sporadic or steady traffic). For example, Ethernet has a range of capacities depending on the specific type of Ethernet cable used (10base5, 10base2, 10baseTor 100baseT). Media type is also a factor in data degradation. For example, 10baseT is category 3 unshielded twisted pair and is more sensitive to environmental conditions than 10base5. 100baseT must be category 5 unshielded twisted pair. These are considerations if you are planning a network for a manufacturing environment that produces a high degree of electrostatic discharge.<INDEXTARGET ID="02.planning10"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: 02.planning10|network planning: media selection --><INDEXTARGET ID="02.planning11"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: 02.planning11|selecting network media --></PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>Two of the available systems, Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), provide a way of transferring Internet Protocol (IP) packets over a serial telephone line; this means that SLIP and PPP users can access network resources much as if they were on the local area network. PPP can also be used with Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), available on certain platforms. ISDN uses a high-speed digital telephone line to achieve higher throughput than is possible with a modem connection.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Another system, UNIX to UNIX Copy Program (UUCP), is an older system, primarily designed for transferring information (such as network news and electronic mail) in batch mode over serial lines.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Higher-performance network connections can be made using specialized hardware. These connections are usually over dedicated lines, leased from a telephone company, or over the telephone company's packet-switched network. </PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>The Internet uses Domain Name Service (DNS) to map domain names to IP addresses. Therefore, even if you don't use DNS internally, you must provide DNS name servers on the Internet in order to connect your network to the Internet. You should have at least two name servers, a primary and a secondary server. For robustness, the secondary server should not be connected to the Internet through the same gateway as the primary server. Since many organizations are not big enough to have multiple gateways to the Internet, a common solution is to make a reciprocal arrangement with another organization to provide secondary name service for each other. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If you are connecting to the Internet through an Internet service provider, they may be able to provide name service for your organization, or help you locate someone to provide secondary name service if you are able to provide a primary name server.</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>You can register your domain name through your local NIC. See <XREF IDREF="44309" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;About Local Network Information Centers&rdquo;</XREF> for contact information. When you register a domain, you should also register a <ITALICS>reverse domain</ITALICS>, also known as an <ITALICS>IN-ADDR </ITALICS>domain.

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="11190">Guidelines for a Subnetwork</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Subnetting allows you to divide a single network into a set of subnetworks. Subnetworks are useful for many reasons. For example, if you have a satellite office that connects to your main network, it should have its own network number or subnet. If you have a large number of systems to be connected by Ethernet, you may have to use subnets to overcome physical limitations on the number of hosts and length of network cable that can be supported on a single Ethernet network.&space;<INDEXTARGET ID="02.planning45"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: 02.planning45|network planning: subnetworks --><INDEXTARGET ID="02.planning46"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: 02.planning46|subnetworks: planning --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Subnetting should be considered when the class limits are unrealistic for your network. For example, a Class B network gives you approximately 64,000 stations per network. This far exceeds the maximum number of stations allowed on most networks. Subnetting allows the local organization to designate some of the host ID bits to form a subnet. Subnetting generates a realistic number of stations per network. All changes are made at the local site by the site administration group and are transparent to off-site stations.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Planning is required for subnetting a network (see <INDEXTARGET ID="02.planning47"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: 02.planning47|Internet addresses: and subnetworks --><XREF IDREF="17646" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Subnetting a Network&rdquo;</XREF> for subnetting procedure). Primarily, you must determine how to partition the host part of the 32-bit Internet address. To define local subnetworks, use bits from the host number sequence to extend the network portion of the Internet address. This reinterpretation of IP addresses is done only for local networks. It is not visible to off-site stations. You should have at least a rough idea of the physical layout of the network before you plan your subnets. For example, you might want to have a subnet for each floor of your building. If you have a branch office that's connected to your main network, you might want to set aside one or more subnets for it. In some cases, you may want to set aside a subnet for SLIP and PPP clients (see <XREF IDREF="29777" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;SLIP and PPP Routing and Address Allocation&rdquo;</XREF>).<INDEXTARGET ID="02.planning48"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: 02.planning48|subnetworks: Internet addresses for --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Sites with a Class A network number have 24 bits of host part with which to work; sites with a Class B network number, 16 bits; and sites with a Class C network number, 8 bits. For example, if your site has a Class B network number, each station on the network has an Internet address that contains 16 bits for the network number and 16 bits for the host number. To define 254 local subnetworks, each possessing at most 254 stations, you can use 8 bits from the host portion of the address. Construct new network numbers by concatenating the original 16-bit network number with the extra 8 bits containing the local subnetwork number. <INDEXTARGET ID="02.planning49"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: 02.planning49|Internet addresses: classes of --></PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>For example, the Class B Internet address for an entire site as seen from other sites might be 128.50.

150.26.80.1    green.salad.com green
150.26.80.2    tossed.salad.com tossed
150.26.80.3    jello.salad.com jello
&lt;IP address> &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;host>.&lt;domain> &lt;host> &lt;alias>
</CODE>
<NOTE><PREFIX>Note</PREFIX>Host numbers 0 and 255 are reserved, and shouldn't be used.</NOTE>
<PARAGRAPH>Systems with more than one network interface may be connected to more than one subnet, and require one address for each connected interface. Each interface should be assigned an address from the subnet that the interface is connected to. For example, if fruit.salad.com acts as a gateway between the 150.26.80 net and the 150.26.42 net, it might have the following entries:</PARAGRAPH>
<CODE>
150.26.80.19   fruit.salad.com fruit
150.26.42.1    gate-fruit.salad.com gate-fruit
</CODE>
<PARAGRAPH>Even if you're planning on using NIS or BIND for hostname resolution, you will probably want to put together an <FILENAME>/etc/hosts</FILENAME> file. If you install this on your systems as you attach them to the network, you'll be able to communicate while you get NIS or BIND up and running.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>You should also establish some policy for allocating IP addresses for new systems once the network is in place. If your organization is large, you might want to delegate this authority to separate organizational units. For example, the branch office with its own subnet should allocate IP addresses as needed from its subnet. If your organization is divided up into subdomains, you might want to assign authority over certain subnets to subdomain administrators.</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>NFS should be considered in a network when you want to share files between stations. With NFS, software or data used by a group is put on an NFS server. Authorized NFS clients access the data over the network when needed. This approach ensures consistent information, frees up disk space on client stations, and simplifies the backup procedure. NFS is an optional software product and is described in the <DOCTITLE>ONC3/NFS Administrator's Guide</DOCTITLE>.</PARAGRAPH>
