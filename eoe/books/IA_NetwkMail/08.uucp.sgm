<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="12089">Choosing TCP/IP or UUCP</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>This section compares UUCP and the TCP/IP protocol suite for various purposes. You can use them together, each for the tasks for which it is best suited. Both UUCP and TCP/IP software are standard features of the IRIX operating system. To use the TCP/IP software, you must have one of these communications mechanisms:<INDEXTARGET ID="08.uucp3"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: 08.uucp3|UUCP: and TCP/IP --></PARAGRAPH>

</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>To use UUCP, you must be connected to a serial network or to any TCP/IP network. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>TCP/IP provides reliable interactive and batch services. UUCP is a batch-mode service; when you enter a <COMMAND>uucp</COMMAND> command, it is placed in a queue with other commands. The system checks the queue at regular intervals and executes the commands that it finds. After your command is carried out, UUCP reports the results of the command. The time it takes to carry out a command on a remote station varies on different stations. <XREF IDREF="87312" TYPE="TABLE">Table&nbsp;8-1</XREF> shows a comparison of features of TCP/IP and UUCP. </PARAGRAPH>

(801-type ACUs do not contain a modem. Therefore, a separate modem is required and must be connected to a different line, defined in the Line field.) The need for a separate modem line means that one line would be allocated to the modem and another to the dialer. Because non-801 dialers do not normally use this configuration, they ignore the Line2 field, but it must still contain a hyphen (-) or the word <KEYWORD>null</KEYWORD> as a place holder. A place holder is necessary for most modems.</PARAGRAPH>

</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>Some devices can be used at any speed, so the keyword <KEYWORD>Any</KEYWORD> can be used in the Class field. If <KEYWORD>Any</KEYWORD> is used, the line will match any speed requested in a Systems file entry. If this field is Any and the Systems file Class field is Any, the speed defaults to 9600 bps. If the keyword <KEYWORD>ACU</KEYWORD> or <KEYWORD>Direct</KEYWORD> is used in the Type field, the Class field might contain only the speed of the device. However, the speed can also be preceded by a letter (for example, <VARIABLE>C9600</VARIABLE>, <VARIABLE>D9600</VARIABLE>) to differentiate between classes of dialers (Centrex or Dimension PBX). Including the dialer class is necessary in larger offices that have more than one type of telephone network: One network may be dedicated to serving only internal communications while another handles external. In such a case, it becomes necessary to distinguish which line(s) should be used for internal and which for external.</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="73368">UUCP Dialer-Token-Pairs Field</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>This field contains pairs of dialers and tokens. The Dialer portion may be the name of an automatic-dial modem, or ``Direct'' for a direct-link device. You can have any number of Dialer-Token-Pair (DTP) fields. The Token portion may be supplied immediately following the Dialer portion; if not present, the Token portion will be taken from a related entry in the Systems file.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>This field has the format</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
dialer   token   dialer   token
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>The last pair may or may not be present, depending on the associated device (dialer). In most cases, the last pair contains only a Dialer portion and the Token portion is retrieved from the Phone field of the <FILENAME>Systems</FILENAME> file entry. A valid entry in the Dialer portion may be defined in the <FILENAME>Dialers</FILENAME> file.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The DTP field can be structured in different ways, depending on the device associated with the entry.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If an automatic-dial modem is connected directly to a port on your computer, the DTP field of the associated<FILENAME>&space;Devices</FILENAME> file entry will have only one pair. This pair is normally the name of the modem. This name is used to match the particular <FILENAME>Devices </FILENAME>file entry with an entry in the <FILENAME>Dialers</FILENAME> file. Therefore, the Dialer field must match the first field of a <FILENAME>Dialers</FILENAME> file entry:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
Devices: <SCREENDISPLAY>ACU ttyf2 null 9600 212 x telebit</SCREENDISPLAY>
Dialers: <SCREENDISPLAY>telebit =&amp;-% "" \r\p\r\c $ &lt;K\T%%\r>\c</SCREENDISPLAY> ONLINE!
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>Notice that only the Dialer portion (<VARIABLE>telebit</VARIABLE>) is present in the DTP field of the <FILENAME>Devices</FILENAME> file entry. This means that the <VARIABLE>token</VARIABLE> to be passed on to the dialer (in this case the phone number) is taken from the Phone field of a <FILENAME>Systems</FILENAME> file entry. (\T is implied) </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If a direct link is established to a particular computer, the DTP field of the associated entry contains the keyword <KEYWORD>Direct</KEYWORD>. This is true for both types of direct-link entries, <VARIABLE>Direct</VARIABLE> and <VARIABLE>System-Name</VARIABLE>.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If an automatic-dial modem is connected to a switch, your computer must first access the switch; the switch then makes the connection to the modem. This type of entry requires two <VARIABLE>Dialer-Token-Pairs</VARIABLE>. The Dialer portion of each pair (fifth and seventh fields of entry) is used to match entries in the Dialers file:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
Devices: <SCREENDISPLAY>ACU ttyf2 null 9600 212 x t2500 telebit T25</SCREENDISPLAY>
Dialers: <SCREENDISPLAY>telebit "" "" \pr\ps\c est:\007 \E\D\e \007</SCREENDISPLAY>
Dialers: <SCREENDISPLAY>T25 =&amp;-% "" \r\p\r\c $ &lt;K\T%%\r>\c </SCREENDISPLAY>ONLINE!
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>In the first pair, <VARIABLE>t2500</VARIABLE>&space;is the Dialer and <VARIABLE>telebit</VARIABLE> is the <VARIABLE>token</VARIABLE> that is passed to the Develcon switch to tell it which device (telebit modem) to connect to your computer. This token is unique for each modem switch since each switch may be set up differently. Once the telebit modem has been connected, the second pair is accessed, where <VARIABLE>T25</VARIABLE> is the dialer and the token (the telephone number) is retrieved from the <FILENAME>Systems</FILENAME> file. (See the discussion of the Systems file's Phone field in <XREF IDREF="99102" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;UUCP Systems File&rdquo;</XREF>.)</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>As shown in the preceding section, the fifth field in a <FILENAME>Devices</FILENAME> file entry is an index into the <FILENAME>Dialers</FILENAME> file or a special dialer type. An attempt is made to match the fifth field in the Devices file with the first field of each <FILENAME>Dialers</FILENAME> file entry. In addition, each odd-numbered <FILENAME>Devices</FILENAME> field, starting with the seventh position, is used as an index into the <FILENAME>Dialers</FILENAME> file.

<PARAGRAPH>The <FILENAME>Dialer</FILENAME>&space;field matches the fifth and additional odd-numbered fields in the <FILENAME>Devices</FILENAME> file. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The <VARIABLE>substitutions</VARIABLE> field is a translate string: The first of each pair of characters is mapped to the second character in the pair.

<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM><CMDLINEOPT>SENDFILES</CMDLINEOPT></HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>When a remote computer calls your computer and completes its work, it may attempt to take work your computer has queued for it. The <CMDLINEOPT>SENDFILES</CMDLINEOPT> option specifies whether your computer can send the work queued for the remote computer.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The string shown here specifies that your computer may send the work that is queued for the remote computer as long as it logged in as one of the names in the <CMDLINEOPT>LOGNAME</CMDLINEOPT> option:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
SENDFILES=yes
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>This string is mandatory if your computer is in a &ldquo;passive mode&rdquo; with respect to the remote computer.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The string that follows specifies that files queued in your computer will be sent only when your computer calls the remote computer:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
SENDFILES=call
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>The call value is the default for the <CMDLINEOPT>SENDFILE</CMDLINEOPT> option. This option is significant only in LOGNAME entries, because MACHINE entries apply when calls are made to remote computers. If the option is used with a MACHINE entry, it will be ignored.</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM><CMDLINEOPT>READ</CMDLINEOPT> and <CMDLINEOPT>WRITE</CMDLINEOPT> </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>&lbreak;These options specify the various parts of the filesystem that<COMMAND>&space;uucico</COMMAND> can read from or write to. The <CMDLINEOPT>READ</CMDLINEOPT> and <CMDLINEOPT>WRITE</CMDLINEOPT> options can be used with either MACHINE or LOGNAME entries.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The default for both the <CMDLINEOPT>READ</CMDLINEOPT> and <CMDLINEOPT>WRITE</CMDLINEOPT> options is the <FILENAME>uucppublic</FILENAME> directory, as shown in the following strings:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
READ=/var/spool/uucppublic
WRITE=/var/spool/uucppublic
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>These strings specify permission to access any file that can be accessed by a local user with &ldquo;other&rdquo; permissions:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
READ=/ WRITE=/
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>Because this suggestion may compromise security, use it only if required.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The value of these entries is a colon-separated list of pathnames. The <CMDLINEOPT>READ</CMDLINEOPT> option is for requesting files, and the <CMDLINEOPT>WRITE</CMDLINEOPT> option for depositing files. One of the values must be the prefix of any full pathname of a file coming in or going out. To grant permission to deposit files in <FILENAME>/usr/news</FILENAME> as well as in the public directory, the following values would be used with the <CMDLINEOPT>WRITE</CMDLINEOPT> option:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
WRITE=/var/spool/uucppublic:/usr/news
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>Note that if you use the <CMDLINEOPT>READ</CMDLINEOPT> and <CMDLINEOPT>WRITE</CMDLINEOPT> options, you must specify all pathnames because the pathnames are not added to the default list. For instance, if the <FILENAME>/usr/news</FILENAME> pathname were the only one specified in a <CMDLINEOPT>WRITE</CMDLINEOPT> option, permission to deposit files in the public directory would be denied.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>You should be careful which directories you make accessible for reading and writing by remote stations. For example, you probably wouldn't want remote computers to be able to write over your<FILENAME>&space;/etc/passwd</FILENAME> file, so <FILENAME>/etc</FILENAME> shouldn't be open to writes.</PARAGRAPH>

</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM><CMDLINEOPT>NOREAD</CMDLINEOPT> and <CMDLINEOPT>NOWRITE</CMDLINEOPT> </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>&lbreak;The <CMDLINEOPT>NOREAD</CMDLINEOPT> and <CMDLINEOPT>NOWRITE</CMDLINEOPT> options specify exceptions to the <CMDLINEOPT>READ</CMDLINEOPT> and <CMDLINEOPT>WRITE</CMDLINEOPT> options or defaults.

<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM><CMDLINEOPT>CALLBACK</CMDLINEOPT></HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>The <CMDLINEOPT>CALLBACK </CMDLINEOPT>option is used in LOGNAME entries to specify that no transaction will take place until the calling station is called back. You would use <CMDLINEOPT>CALLBACK</CMDLINEOPT> for two reasons: From a security standpoint, if you call back a station you can be sure it is the station it says it is. If you are doing long data transmissions, you can choose the station that will be billed for the longer call.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The string that follows specifies that your computer must call the remote computer back before any file transfers will take place:</PARAGRAPH>

<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM><CMDLINEOPT>COMMANDS</CMDLINEOPT></HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>The <CMDLINEOPT>COMMANDS</CMDLINEOPT> option can be hazardous to the security of your station. Use it with extreme care.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The <COMMAND>uux</COMMAND> program generates remote execution requests and queues them to be transferred to the remote computer. Files and a command are sent to the target computer for remote execution.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The<CMDLINEOPT>&space;COMMANDS</CMDLINEOPT> option can be used in MACHINE entries to specify the commands that a remote computer can execute on your computer. Note that <CMDLINEOPT>COMMANDS</CMDLINEOPT> is not used in a LOGNAME entry; <CMDLINEOPT>COMMANDS </CMDLINEOPT>in MACHINE entries defines command permissions, whether you call the remote station or it calls you.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>This string indicates the default commands that a remote computer can execute on your computer:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
COMMANDS=rmail
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>If a command string is used in a MACHINE entry, the default commands are overridden. For instance, in the following example, the entry overrides the <CMDLINEOPT>COMMANDS</CMDLINEOPT> default so that the computers <VARIABLE>eagle</VARIABLE>, <VARIABLE>owl</VARIABLE>, and <VARIABLE>hawk</VARIABLE> can now execute <COMMAND>rmail</COMMAND> and<COMMAND>&space;rnews</COMMAND> on your computer:</PARAGRAPH>
<CODE>
MACHINE=eagle:owl:hawk REQUEST=yes
COMMANDS=rmail:/usr/bin/rnews 
READ=/  WRITE=/
</CODE>
<PARAGRAPH>In addition to the names as specified above, there can be full pathnames of commands. For example, this line specifies that command <COMMAND>rmail</COMMAND> use the default path: </PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
COMMANDS=rmail:/usr/bin/rnews:/usr/local/lp
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>The default paths for your computer are <FILENAME>/bin /usr/sbin</FILENAME>, <FILENAME>/usr/bsd</FILENAME>, and <FILENAME>/usr/bin</FILENAME>. When the remote computer specifies <COMMAND>rnews</COMMAND> or <COMMAND>/usr/bin/rnews</COMMAND> for the command to be executed, <COMMAND>/usr/bin/rnews</COMMAND> is executed, regardless of the default path. Likewise, <COMMAND>/usr/local/lp</COMMAND> is the <COMMAND>lp</COMMAND> command that is executed.</PARAGRAPH>
<NOTE><PREFIX>Note</PREFIX>Including the ALL value in the list means that any command from the remote computer(s) specified in the entry is executed. If you use this value, you give the remote computer full access to your computer. Be careful. This value allows far more access than normal users have.</NOTE>
<PARAGRAPH>This string illustrates the greater access:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
COMMANDS=/usr/bin/rnews:ALL:/usr/local/lp
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>Two points about this string should be noted. The ALL value can appear anywhere in the string, and the pathnames specified for <COMMAND>rnews</COMMAND> and <COMMAND>lp</COMMAND> will be used (instead of the default) if the requested command does not contain the full pathnames for <COMMAND>rnews</COMMAND> or <COMMAND>lp</COMMAND>.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The <CMDLINEOPT>VALIDATE</CMDLINEOPT> option should be used with the <CMDLINEOPT>COMMANDS</CMDLINEOPT> option whenever potentially dangerous commands like <COMMAND>cat</COMMAND> and <COMMAND>uucp</COMMAND> are specified with the<CMDLINEOPT>&space;COMMANDS</CMDLINEOPT> option. Any command that reads or writes files is potentially dangerous to local security when executed by the UUCP remote execution daemon (<COMMAND>uuxqt</COMMAND>).</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM><CMDLINEOPT>VALIDATE</CMDLINEOPT></HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>The <CMDLINEOPT>VALIDATE</CMDLINEOPT> option is used in conjunction with the <CMDLINEOPT>COMMANDS</CMDLINEOPT> option when specifying commands that are potentially dangerous to your computer's security. It is used to provide a certain degree of verification of the caller's identity. The use of the <CMDLINEOPT>VALIDATE</CMDLINEOPT> option requires that privileged computers have a unique login and password for UUCP transactions. An important aspect of this validation is that the login and password associated with this entry be protected. If an outsider gets that information, that particular <CMDLINEOPT>VALIDATE </CMDLINEOPT>option can no longer be considered secure. (<CMDLINEOPT>VALIDATE</CMDLINEOPT> is merely an added level of security on top of the <CMDLINEOPT>COMMANDS</CMDLINEOPT> option, though it is a more secure way to open command access than ALL.)</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Give careful consideration to providing a remote system with a privileged login and password for UUCP transactions. Giving another system these privileges is like giving anyone on that computer a normal login and password on your computer. Therefore, if you cannot trust everyone at the remote site, do not provide that system with a privileged login and password.</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM><CMDLINEOPT>LOGNAME</CMDLINEOPT></HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>The <CMDLINEOPT>LOGNAME</CMDLINEOPT> option ensures that remote stations attempting to log in to your computer have login privileges. The following <CMDLINEOPT>LOGNAME</CMDLINEOPT> entry specifies that if one of the remote computers that claims to be <VARIABLE>eagle</VARIABLE>, <VARIABLE>owl</VARIABLE>, or <VARIABLE>hawk</VARIABLE> logs in to your computer, it must have used the login <VARIABLE>uucpfriend</VARIABLE>: </PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
LOGNAME=uucpfriend VALIDATE=eagle:owl:hawk
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>As can be seen, if an outsider gets the uucpfriend login and password, marauding is trivial.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>But what does this have to do with the <CMDLINEOPT>COMMANDS</CMDLINEOPT> option, which appears only in <CMDLINEOPT>MACHINE</CMDLINEOPT> entries? It links the <CMDLINEOPT>MACHINE</CMDLINEOPT> entry (and <CMDLINEOPT>COMMANDS</CMDLINEOPT> option) with a <CMDLINEOPT>LOGNAME</CMDLINEOPT> entry associated with a privileged login. This link is needed because the execution daemon is not running while the remote computer is logged in. In fact, it is an asynchronous process with no knowledge of which computer sent the execution request. Therefore, the real question is, how does your computer know where the execution files came from?</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Each remote computer has its own &ldquo;spool&rdquo; directory on your computer. These spool directories have write permission given only to the UUCP programs. The execution files from the remote computer are put in its spool directory after being transferred to your computer. When the <COMMAND>uuxqt</COMMAND> daemon runs, it can use the spool directory name to find the MACHINE entry in the <FILENAME>Permissions</FILENAME> file and get the COMMANDS list or, if the computer name does not appear in the <FILENAME>Permissions</FILENAME> file, the default list is used.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The following example shows the relationship between the <CMDLINEOPT>MACHINE</CMDLINEOPT> and <CMDLINEOPT>LOGNAME</CMDLINEOPT> entries:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
MACHINE=eagle:owl:hawk REQUEST=yes  \ 
</EXAMPLE>
<CODE>
COMMANDS=rmail:/usr/bin/rnews \
READ=/  WRITE=/
LOGNAME=uucpz VALIDATE=eagle:owl:hawk \
REQUEST=yes SENDFILES=yes \
READ=/  WRITE=/
</CODE>
<PARAGRAPH>The value in the <CMDLINEOPT>COMMANDS</CMDLINEOPT> option means that remote mail and <COMMAND>/usr/bin/rnews</COMMAND> can be executed by remote users.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>In the first entry, you must make the assumption that when you want to call one of the computers listed, you are really calling either <VARIABLE>eagle</VARIABLE>, <VARIABLE>owl</VARIABLE>, or <VARIABLE>hawk</VARIABLE>. Therefore, any files put into one of the <VARIABLE>eagle</VARIABLE>, <VARIABLE>owl</VARIABLE>, or <VARIABLE>hawk</VARIABLE> spool directories is put there by one of those computers. If a remote computer logs in and says that it is one of these three computers, its execution files will also be put in the privileged spool directory. You therefore have to validate that the computer has the privileged login <COMMAND>uucpz</COMMAND>.</PARAGRAPH>
