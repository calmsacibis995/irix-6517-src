<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Audience for This Guide</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The <ITALICS>Diskless Workstation Administration Guide</ITALICS> is written for system and network administrators who will be responsible for managing a Silicon Graphics server that supports one or more diskless workstation clients. It assumes that the audience has experience with basic system administration on an IRIX or other UNIX-based system. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Experience in maintaining IRIX filesystems and NFS and in installing Silicon Graphics software is helpful, but not required, for installing and maintaining Diskless software. A familiarity with various families of Silicon Graphics workstations is also helpful, particularly for doing troubleshooting procedures. At some sites, familiarity with network administration is required to prepare network software for the diskless implementation. </PARAGRAPH>
