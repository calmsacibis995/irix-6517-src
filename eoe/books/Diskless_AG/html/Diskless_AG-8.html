<H1 class="SGITPL-head">Chapter 5<BR> Updating Software on Diskless Trees</h1><p>This chapter explains how to update the software for a diskless implementation that is already running an earlier software release. It explains how to install the updated share tree and client trees, and how to create a new client tree that contains updated software. It also explains how to add software options to a share tree and client tree. <p>This chapter contains these sections:<ul><li><A HREF="Diskless_AG-8.html#SGI2" TARGET=_top>"Points to Keep in Mind"</A><br><br><li><A HREF="Diskless_AG-8.html#SGI3" TARGET=_top>"Updating a Share Tree"</A><br><br><li><A HREF="Diskless_AG-8.html#SGI4" TARGET=_top>"Updating Existing Client Trees"</A><br><br><li><A HREF="Diskless_AG-8.html#SGI5" TARGET=_top>"When New Clients Need Updated Trees"</A><br><br><li><A HREF="Diskless_AG-8.html#SGI6" TARGET=_top>"Software Options as Updates"</A></ul><HR noshade><A NAME="SGI2"></A>
<h2 class="SGITPL-head">Points to Keep in Mind</h2><p>When you use these procedures, keep software compatibility considerations in mind: the revision level of the server software supporting the diskless implementation must be equal to or greater than the software on the share tree. In addition, you must update the share tree before updating any of its client trees. <p>All clients should be shut down while you update their share tree. An individual client should be shut down while you update its client tree. <P><B>Caution: </B>If you do not shut down clients to perform an update, they might crash during the update or not operate properly after the installation. <HR noshade><A NAME="SGI3"></A>
<h2 class="SGITPL-head">Updating a Share Tree</h2><p>The update procedure replaces the software on a share tree with a later software release. The update procedure also adds new subsystems to the share tree and removes subsystems that are no longer needed. <p>Because software was previously installed in the tree that you are updating, <i>inst</i> has a record of the installation; it uses this record to identify currently installed software for which the new software contains a revision. In <i>inst</i> listings, these subsystems are marked with the letters i U, indicating that they are updates and are selected for installation.<p>The following procedure explains how to update software on a share tree: <ol><li>Shut down all client workstations in this class. <br><br><li>Change to the <i>/var/boot</i> directory on the server. <pre># <B>cd /var/boot</B></pre><li>Start share_inst.<p>Enter the <i>share_inst</i> command, substituting the name of your share tree for the one shown in this example: <pre>#<B> ./share_inst -r IRIX_65-32</B></pre><P><B>Note: </B>If you have not shut down the clients using this share tree, <i>share_inst</i> displays this message: <PRE>       WARNING: release IRIX_65-32 is still serving clients.
       continue to update IRIX_65-32 (Y/N)? </PRE><p>If you answer yes, <i>share_inst</i> posts a final warning: <PRE>       Checking clients status:
       client client_1 ... UP 
       WARNING: clients will be out of sync. Clients which
       are UP may crash.</PRE><p>If clients have been shut down (or if you proceed with the installation in spite of the warnings), <i>share_inst</i> displays a confirmation prompt: <PRE>About to install shared tree at /diskless/share/IRIX_65-32......
Enter confirmation (y/Y):</PRE><li>Enter <TT><B>y</B></TT> or <TT><B>Y</B></TT> (yes) to confirm the installation. <p>After your entry, the Inst Main Menu is displayed:<PRE>Default location of new software is &lt;<var>previous installation location</var>&gt;
If you are a first-time inst user, give the command "help beginner".

(Notice the "default location" message above the Main menu.) <ul><br><li>If you plan to install the updates from the default location, press the Enter key and go to Step 6. <P><B>Note: </B>If you used CD-ROM as the source for the previous installation, insert the CD before pressing the Enter key.<br><br><li>If you plan to install the updates from a location other than the default, specify the location with the from option, insert a CD if one is required, and press Enter, then go to Step 6. </ul><br><li>Enter <TT><B>list</B></TT> to determine the default installation selections.<p>The <i>inst</i> utility automatically identifies software updates and selects them for installation. By default, inst selects all new subsystems (designated by the letters <i>i N</i>) and all subsystems that are updates (designated by the letter<i> i U</i>). Use the <i>list</i> option to check these selections and their space requirements before installing them. <br><br><li>Change the default selections if necessary. <p>If you want to change the default selections, use the <i>step i</i> option to advance through the list of selected subsystems on the source. Type one of these entries for each subsystem that the <i>step</i> option posts: <br><br><dl><TT><B>Enter</B></TT><dd><br>To leave the selection unchanged. <TT><B>r Enter</B></TT><dd><br>If it is marked <i>i</i> and you do not want it installed <TT><B>i Enter</B></TT><dd><br>If it is not marked <i>i</i> and you want to install it. </dl><br><li>Enter <TT><B>go</B></TT> to launch the installation. <p>When your selections are satisfactory, enter the <i>go</i> option to launch the installation. As your share tree software is updated, you will see messages such as the examples shown below. <PRE>Removing old versions of selected eoe.sw.xfs subsystems
Installing new versions of selected eoe.sw.xfs subsystems
Removing old versions of selected desktop_eoe.sw.envm subsystems
Installing new versions of selected desktop_eoe.sw.envm subsystems</PRE><p>At the end of the installation, you see this message: <PRE>Installation and/or removal succeeded.</PRE><li>Enter <TT><B>quit</B></TT> to complete the update procedure. <p>Allow the <i>exit</i> commands several minutes to process. <P><B>Caution: </B>Do not make any entries that will interrupt processing of the <i>exit</i> commands (such as CtrlhostnameC, for example). Doing so can result in damage to your system. </ol><p>When processing is complete, the share tree for the class you specified is updated, and you are ready to update client trees for the class. <HR noshade><A NAME="SGI4"></A>
<h2 class="SGITPL-head">Updating Existing Client Trees</h2><p>The <i>clone_client</i> program for client trees automatically installs updated software from the share tree into an existing client tree. This program installs all subsystems that are new to the client tree and all subsystems for which the share tree contains a newer version. It also removes any subsystem on the client for which there is no corresponding subsystem in the share tree   -       these subsystems are considered obsolete.<P><B>Note: </B>If you are adding a new client to the diskless implementation and you want its client tree to contain updated software, you must complete Step 2 of this procedure twice. (See <A HREF="Diskless_AG-8.html#SGI5" TARGET=_top>"When New Clients Need Updated Trees"</A> for an explanation.)<p>Updating clients involves three general steps: <ol><li>Shut down the workstation whose client tree you are updating. <p>If you do not shut down the client, <i>clone_client</i> warns you that it might crash during the update. <br><br><li>Use <i>clone_client</i> to launch an automatic update of client trees. <p>When you use <i>clone_client</i> to update a client tree, <i>inst</i> takes these actions:<ul><br><li>Installs all new subsystems. This software is on the share tree but is not yet installed on the client tree; these subsystems are marked N in <i>inst</i> listings.<br><br><li>Installs all subsystems in the client tree for which there is a newer version in the share tree; these subsystems are marked U in <i>inst</i> listings.<br><br><li>Removes any subsystems from the client tree that do not exist in the share tree; these subsystems are considered obsolete.</ul><p>If you prefer to select the software to be updated, complete the instructions in <A HREF="Diskless_AG-7.html#SGI10" TARGET=_top>"Client and Swap Tree Installation Procedure"</A> instead of using <i>clone_client</i> program. <br><br><li>Reboot the client workstation. <p>See <A HREF="Diskless_AG-7.html#SGI12" TARGET=_top>"Booting a Client Workstation" in Chapter 4</A> for instructions. </ol><p>After the boot procedure is completed, the client is operating with updated software. <HR noshade><A NAME="SGI5"></A>
<h2 class="SGITPL-head">When New Clients Need Updated Trees</h2><p>If you want to create a new tree containing updated software (that is, put a new client workstation into service running the updated software), you must run <i>client_inst</i> twice. The first time that <i>client_inst</i> invokes the <i>inst</i> program, <i>inst</i> searches the client tree for a record describing previously installed software. Because no record exists on a new client tree, <i>inst</i> installs a baseline version of the software, without adding updates. The second time that <i>cl</i><i>ient_inst</i> invokes <i>inst</i>, <i>inst</i> uses the baseline software to add the updates to the new tree. <HR noshade><A NAME="SGI6"></A>
<h2 class="SGITPL-head">Software Options as Updates</h2><p>Whenever you add a software option, you must add the software to the share tree first. Then, add it to the client tree of each diskless workstation that is to use the option. Options that you add to a share or client tree need not be installed on the server containing the trees. <A NAME="SGI7"></A>
<h3 class="SGITPL-head">Adding Options to a Share Tree</h3><p>To add a software option to the share tree, follow these steps: <ol><li>Enter the <i>share_inst</i> command to install software on a share tree. <p>Your entry will look like the example that follows. In this example, 32bitIRIX_65 is the share tree to which the option is being added: <pre><B># /var/boot/share_inst -r 32bitIRIX_65</B></pre><p>After your entry, <i>share_inst</i> asks you for a confirmation, then the <i>inst</i> Main menu is displayed: <PRE>Default location of new software is &lt;<var>previous installation location</var>&gt;
If you are a first-time inst user, give the command "help beginner".

 8. keep [keywords][names]    Do not install or remove these subsystems
 9. step [keywords][names]    Enter interactive mode for install/remove/keep
10. conflicts [choice...]     List or resolve installation conflicts 
11. help [topic]              Get help in general or on a specific word
12. view ...                  Go to the View Commands Window
13. admin                     Go to the Administrative Commands Menu
14. quit                      Terminate software installation<br>Inst&gt; </PRE><br><br><li>Enter <TT><B>from</B></TT> to specify a different software location, if necessary. <p>The<i> inst</i> utility assumes that you are installing the software option from the same location as the previous installation (the "default location" message above the Main Menu specifies CD, because no options have previously been installed on this tree). If you plan to use the default location, go to Step 4. <p>If you plan to install the software from a location other than the default, use the from option to specify the new location. See the <i>inst</i> online help if you need instructions. <br><br><li>Enter <TT><B>keep I </B></TT>to clear unwanted selections. <p>Software at the installation location is likely to have many subsystems selected for installation in addition to the option you want to install. The <TT><B>keep I </B></TT>entry tells <i>inst</i> to ignore all subsystem selections except those that are currently installed. <p>After your entry, <i>inst</i> identifies the software at the installation location and posts a list such as the partial listing shown in this example: <pre>Reading product description from guest@bigsgi:/d2/32bitIRIX65</pre><li>Enter <TT><B>install</B></TT><var>option_name</var> to select the software option. <p>For example, if you want to install the MineSet product option, your entry would look like this: <pre>inst&gt; <B>install MineSet</B></pre><li>Enter <TT><B>list</B></TT> to verify the software that you selected: <pre>Inst&gt; <B>list</B></pre><li>Enter <TT><B>go</B></TT> to launch the installation: <pre>Inst&gt; <B>go</B></pre><li>Enter <TT><B>quit</B></TT> to finish the installation: <pre>Inst&gt; <B>quit</B></pre></ol><p>When processing is complete, the option is added to the share tree. The option can now be added to client trees that will be using it. <A NAME="SGI8"></A>
<h3 class="SGITPL-head">Adding Options to Client Trees</h3><p>This section describes the procedure for adding a software option to a client tree. The following steps must be completed for each client using the new option. The option must already be installed on the share tree when you do this procedure. <ol><li>Enter the <i>client_inst</i> command to add software to a client tree:<pre><B>/var/boot/client_inst -r IRIX_65-32 -c O2 -h starlite</B></pre><p>In this example, <i>starlite</i>, the client using the IRIX_65-32 share tree is receiving the software option. After your entry, <i>client_inst</i> asks you for a confirmation, then the Inst Main menu is displayed. <br><br><li>Enter <TT><B>keep I </B></TT>to clear unwanted subsystem selections. <p>Because many subsystems in the share tree are selected for installation, you need to clear these selections before going on with the installation. The <TT><B>keep I </B></TT>entry tells <i>inst</i> to ignore all subsystem selections except those that are currently installed. <br><br><li>Enter <TT><B>install</B></TT> to select the software that you want to add. <pre>Inst&gt; <B>install MineSet</B></pre><li>Enter <TT><B>list</B></TT> to verify the software that you selected. <pre>Inst&gt; <B>list</B></pre><li>Enter <TT><B>go</B></TT> to launch the installation. <pre>inst&gt; <B>go</B></pre><p>After your entry, <i>inst</i> computes disk space changes, then installs the software option. <br><br><li>Enter <TT><B>quit</B></TT> to finish the installation. <pre>Inst&gt; <B>quit</B></pre></ol><p>When processing is complete, the option is added to the client tree and is available to users of this diskless workstation.
