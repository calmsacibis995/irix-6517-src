<CHAPTER LBL="5"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="10341">Updating Software on Diskless Trees</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>This chapter explains how to update the software for a diskless implementation that is already running an earlier software release. It explains how to install the updated share tree and client trees, and how to create a new client tree that contains updated software. It also explains how to add software options to a share tree and client tree. <INDEXTARGET ID="ch051"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch051|IRIX:on servers --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch052"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch052|server:IRIX version on --></PARAGRAPH>
