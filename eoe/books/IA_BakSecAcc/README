CRITICAL!

The new PAM chapter (pam.doc), which is in rough draft form, 
must be removed from the book build for IRIX 6.5.3 release.
At the last minute it was dropped from this release and pushed
to 6.5.4.

The new illustration to be eventually added to pam.doc is
located in artiste.engr.sgi.com:/usr/tmp.  It's called
"overall.organization.ai".  Dany Galgani did the work.
It needs review.

When PAM info is added, add info about the chapter
to list of chapter descriptions in "About this Guide".

Copyright information to cover the PAM-Linux source text
must be added.  Queried production on exactly how to do so.

Hi Karen,

Yes, the Frame front matter can expand to accommodate more text, so
that won't
be a problem. I'd put it right before the trademark paragraph (in
addition to
our standard stuff). Let your production editor know that you'll be
turning
over some odd-looking stuff. I'd introduce it with a heading
something like:

Copyright/disclaimer for Chapter 6, "Pluggable Authentication
Modules"

Then, you're right, it looks as if you list the copyright notice in
its
entirety and the all caps paragraph (in really small type).

The "binary" stuff I don't believe applies to the docs, but rather
to the s/w.
You'll have to find out if the s/w will ship in binary form (at the
same time,
may as well find out if the "GNU GPL" stuff applies to this). If
not, you stop
with the copyright and the all caps stuff.

Is so, it looks as if you list in the doc:

- The copyright notice AND
- From "Redistribution and use...." through the three points AND
- The all caps paragraph

We've had odd copyright/disclaimers in the past, and we just dump
stuff onto
the acknowledgments page, which can run to more than one page if
necessary.

Let me know if I haven't addressed all your concerns.

Have a lovely weekend.

Cindy

Changed most references to Linux-PAM to just PAM. However, notes by
original author on presentation of examples and file names and such
that are specific to Linux-PAM were left in for the review.  It
may be this level of detail will be dropped, but we need to
have *all* examples and references to file names and directories
checked and verified.  NOTE: This is still true after the first review,
although some references were cleared up by Dean Roe, who's not
on the project any longer.

Text for "What's New in This Guide" if that is implemented
for the 6.5.3 release:

  Revised information about restoring root filesystems
  in the section "Recovering a Filesystem With restore."
