<CHAPTER LBL="3"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="79602">Troubleshooting Backup and Recovery</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>From time to time you might experience backup failures. It is vitally important that you determine the cause of the failure. Most often, the failure is due to worn or faulty media. Proceeding without determining the cause of a failure makes all your future backups suspect and defeats the purpose of backups. </PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="47329">Reading Media from Other Systems</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>You may not be able to read data created on another vendor's workstation, even if it was made using a standard utility, such as <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND> or <COMMAND>cpio</COMMAND>. One problem may be that the tape format is incompatible. Make sure the tape drive where the media originated is compatible with your drive.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If you are unable to verify that the drives are completely compatible, use <VARIABLE>dd</VARIABLE> to see if you can read the tape at the lowest possible level. Place the tape in the drive and enter the command:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
<USERINPUT>mt blksize</USERINPUT>
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>The <REFPAGE>mt(1)</REFPAGE> command with these options tells you the block size used to write the tape. Set the block size correspondingly (or larger) when you use <COMMAND>dd</COMMAND> to read the tape. For example, if the block size used was 1024 bytes, use the command:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
<USERINPUT>dd if=/dev/tape of=/usr/tmp/</USERINPUT><VARIABLE>outfile</VARIABLE><USERINPUT>&space;bs=1024</USERINPUT>
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>If <COMMAND>dd</COMMAND> can read the tape, it displays a count of the number of records it read in and wrote out. If <COMMAND>dd</COMMAND> cannot read the tape, make sure your drive is clean and in good working order. Test the drive with a tape you made on your system. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If you can read the tape with <COMMAND>dd</COMMAND>, and the tape was created using a standard utility, such as <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND> or <COMMAND>cpio</COMMAND>, you may be able to convert the data format with <COMMAND>dd</COMMAND>. Several conversions may help:<INDEXTARGET ID="ch32"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch32|<ITALICS>dd</ITALICS>:conversion options --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch33"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch33|backups:<ITALICS>dd</ITALICS> conversion options --></PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>The <COMMAND>dd</COMMAND> program can convert some completely different formats:</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>ascii&ndash;convert EBCDIC to ASCII </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>ebcdic&ndash;convert ASCII to EBCDIC </PARAGRAPH>

</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>ucase&ndash;map alphabetics to uppercase</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>If the data was written on another vendor's system, you may be able to convert it using <INDEXTARGET ID="ch34"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch34|backups:byte swapping --><COMMAND>dd</COMMAND>, then pipe the converted output to another utility to read it.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Many other vendors use byte-ordering that is the reverse of the order used by IRIX. If this is the case, you can swap them with the following command:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
<USERINPUT>dd if=/dev/tape conv=swab of=/usr/tmp.O/</USERINPUT><VARIABLE>tapefile</VARIABLE>&space;
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>Then use the appropriate archiving utility to extract the information from <FILENAME>/tmp/tapefile</FILENAME> (or whatever filename you choose). For example, use this command to extract information if the<IRIXCOMMAND>&space;tar</IRIXCOMMAND> utility was used to make the tape on a byte-swapped system:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
<USERINPUT>tar xvf /usr/tmp.O/tapefile .</USERINPUT>&space;
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>Note that you could also pipe the <COMMAND>dd</COMMAND> output to another local or remote tape drive (if available) if you do not need or want to create a disk file.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Or you can use the no-swap tape device to read your files with the following <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND> command line:</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH><USERINPUT>tar xvf /dev/rmt/tps0d4ns</USERINPUT>&space;</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Of course, if your tape device is not configured on SCSI unit 4, the exact <FILENAME>/dev/rmt</FILENAME> device name may be slightly different. For example, it could be <FILENAME>/dev/rmt/tps0d3ns</FILENAME>. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>It is good practice to preview the contents of a <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND> archive with the<CMDLINEOPT>&space;t</CMDLINEOPT> keyword before extracting. If the tape contains a system file and was made with absolute pathnames, that system file on your system could be overwritten. For example, if the tape contains a kernel, <FILENAME>/unix</FILENAME>, and you extract it, your own system kernel will be destroyed. The following command previews the above example archive:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
<USERINPUT>tar tvf /tmp/</USERINPUT><VARIABLE>tarfile</VARIABLE>&space;
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>If you wish to extract such a tape on your system without overwriting your current files, use this command to force the extraction to use relative pathnames:<INDEXTARGET ID="ch35"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch35|absolute pathnames, reading tapes --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch36"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch36|tapes, absolute pathnames --></PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
<USERINPUT>tar Rx</USERINPUT>&space;
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>or the corresponding <COMMAND>bru</COMMAND> command:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
<USERINPUT>bru -j</USERINPUT>&space;

Unless you are very sure of what you are doing, you should not simply restore the correct backup version over the incorrect version. This is because the incorrect backup may have altered files that the correct backup won't restore.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>In the worst possible case, you may have to reinstall the system, then apply backups to bring it to the desired state. Here are some basic steps to recovering a filesystem. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If you used incremental backups, such as from <COMMAND>backup</COMMAND> or <COMMAND>bru</COMMAND>:</PARAGRAPH>
<ORDEREDLIST><LIST><PARAGRAPH>Make a complete backup of the current state of the filesystem. If you successfully recover the filesystem, you will not need this particular backup. But if there is a problem, you may need to return to the current, though undesirable, state. </PARAGRAPH>

<ORDEREDLIST><LIST><PARAGRAPH>Make a complete backup of the affected filesystem or directory hierarchy. You may need this not only as protection against an unforeseen problem, but to fill any gaps in your backups. </PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>Bring the system to the condition it was in just before you applied the wrong backup.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If you use an incremental backup scheme, follow steps 2 and 3 above (recovering from the wrong incremental backup).</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If you use only utilities such as <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND> and <COMMAND>cpio</COMMAND> for backups, use what backups you have to get the system to the desired state. </PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>Once the system is as close as possible to the correct state, restore the correct backup. You are finished. If the system is in the desired state, skip the remaining steps.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If you cannot bring the system to the state it was in just before you applied the wrong backup, continue with the next series of steps. </PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>If you cannot manage to bring the system to the correct state (where it was just before you restored the wrong backup), get it as close as possible. </PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>Make a backup of this interim state. </PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>Compare the current interim state with the backup you made at the outset of this process (with the incorrect backup applied) and with the backup you wish to restore. Note which files changed, which were added and removed, and which files remain unchanged in the process of bringing the system to the desired state.</PARAGRAPH>

<ERRORMSG><MSG>unix: dks0d1s0: Process [tar] ran out of disk space
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>This error, or similar errors reporting a shortage of disk space, may occur if you are backing up data to a disk partition that does not have enough free space left to contain the data to be backed up. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Such errors may likewise occur in data restores if the data being recovered does not fit on the destination disk partition. Note that if you are uncompressing data that was compressed for backup, the uncompressed data could easily require twice as much space as the compressed data.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>You may wish to add disk space, reclaim disk space, repartition existing disk space (see <DOCTITLE></DOCTITLE>
<EXTREF IDREF="88526" BOOK="IA_DiskFiles" FILE="" HDG="88526" INFO="">IRIX Admin: Disks and Filesystems</EXTREF>

</ERRORMSG>
<ERRORMSG><MSG>unix: NFS2 getattr failed for server some.host.name: Timed out
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>These and similar network errors only represent a problem if you are using network resources (for example, a remote tape or disk drive) in your backup or recovery procedure. If this is the case, reestablish proper network connections (see <DOCTITLE></DOCTITLE>
<EXTREF IDREF="97829" BOOK="IA_NetwkMail" FILE="" HDG="97829" INFO="">IRIX Admin: Networking and Mail</EXTREF>

</MSG>
</ERRORMSG>
<ERRORMSG><MSG>Could not access device /dev/rmt/tps0d6nr, Device busy
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>These are all examples of tape access errors. Depending on whether you were trying to back up or recover data, the system encountered a problem writing or reading the tape. Be sure there is a tape in the drive indicated in the error message, and that it is not set on write-protect if you are attempting a backup. (Also, tape drives should be periodically cleaned according to manufacturer instructions.)</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If these are not the problem, test the tape for read and/or write capabilities using one or more of the backup and recover utilities. Note that a media error can occur anywhere on a tape; to verify the tape, write and read the entire tape. You can also select &ldquo;Run Confidence Tests&rdquo; from the System toolchest and double-click on the Tape Drive test.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If you have any doubts about the quality of the tape you're using (for example, it is getting old), copy it to a new tape (if it still has good data) and discard it. If you are using a tape drive that you have not used before, verify that the tape type is compatible with the new drive. Run the <REFPAGE>mt(1)</REFPAGE> command to reset the tape drive. Run the <REFPAGE>hinv(1M)</REFPAGE> command to determine if the tape drive is recognized by the system.</PARAGRAPH>
</EXPLANATION>
</ERRORMSG>
<PARAGRAPH>A &ldquo;device already in use&rdquo; or &ldquo;device busy&rdquo; error probably means that some other program was using the tape drive when you tried to access it.</PARAGRAPH>
