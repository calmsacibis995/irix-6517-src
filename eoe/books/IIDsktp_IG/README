For Appa G, DataConversion:
check this appendix to make sure registry is still 
in same location:

for banyan: There was a last minute change in Banyan for the
location of the registry file.  It is now in /var/GoldenGate

Notes by Max Anderson, Technical Writer on 007-2006-110 

Conducted change on title and content 

from: Indigo Magic Desktop Integration Guide
to: IRIX Interactive Desktop Integration Guide

Changed all cross references, variables and hidden index text references within all 
chapters in FrameMaker.
However, I did not change IndigoMagic_IG as the short title in Makefile and Frame
book file for the sake of not breaking any cross book links to this book online.

Kudzu Production Notes, 4/98
----------------------------
All external cross references were created wrong.  Removed all external cross references and input them in by hand using markers 18 and 19.  Trademark information and title of book were incorect.  Had technical editor edit the information based on legal's information. ~Kirsten Pekarek
