 of the <DOCTITLE>IRIX Interactive User Interface Guidelines</DOCTITLE>.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>To make a minimized window image for your application:</PARAGRAPH>
<ORDEREDLIST><LIST><PARAGRAPH>Create an RGB image. If your image is already in RGB format, then all you have to do is resize the image to an appropriate size (look at the setting of the <BOLD>iconImageMaximum</BOLD> resource in <COMMAND>4Dwm</COMMAND> to see the maximum size of the stow icon, currently 85x67). See <XREF IDREF="65843" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Resizing the RGB Image Using imgworks&rdquo;</XREF> for instructions on resizing the image.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If your image is not in RGB format, you must convert it to RGB. One way to do this is to use the Media Recorder tool to obtain your image. See <XREF IDREF="94162" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Using mediarecorder to Get an RGB Format Image&rdquo;</XREF> for instructions.</PARAGRAPH>

<LIST><PARAGRAPH>Scale the image to the correct size. See <XREF IDREF="65843" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Resizing the RGB Image Using imgworks&rdquo;</XREF> for instructions.</PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>Name the image file. The filename should consist of two parts: </PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLISTIND><BULLETIND><PARAGRAPH>The application class name (technically, the <ITALICS>res_name</ITALICS> field of the WM_CLASS property). You can determine the class name by using <ITALICS>xprop</ITALICS> on your application window and looking at the WM_CLASS property. </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLETIND>
<BULLETIND><PARAGRAPH>The<FILENAME>&space;.icon</FILENAME> suffix. </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLETIND>
</BULLETLISTIND>
<PARAGRAPH>This gives you a name of the form <FILENAME>res_name.icon</FILENAME>. For example, if your application's name is &ldquo;chocolate,&rdquo; the name of your image file should be:</PARAGRAPH>
