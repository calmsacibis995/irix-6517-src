The notion of a secure state is defined, and it is proven that each state transition preserves security by moving from secure state to secure state, thereby inductively proving that the system is secure. A system state is defined to be secure if the only permitted access modes of subjects to objects are in accordance with a specific security policy. In order to determine whether or not a specific access mode is allowed, the clearance of a subject is compared to the classification of the object, and a determination is made as to whether the subject is authorized for the specific access mode. <ITALICS>See</ITALICS> star property (*-property) and simple security property.</PARAGRAPH>

The exact definition of the set of computer systems that is being evaluated is called the configuration range. The definition is exact. For example, part numbers of cables that connect keyboards to the system are part of the definition, and use of even a keyboard cable with a part number not in the configuration range will cause the evaluation not to be valid for that system.

<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>Mandatory Integrity </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>&lbreak;A means of restricting access to objects based on the integrity (as represented by a label) of the information contained in the objects and the subjects. Integrity is necessary to identify the Trusted IRIX/CMW TCB. In order to do so, some mechanism for restricting what programs may be executed by the superuser, auditor, and any other trusted users must be implemented. The Mandatory Integrity (MINT) component of the security label provides TCB isolation by denying access to programs that have not been sufficiently analyzed (or have been and are deemed untrustworthy to users with high integrity requirements). The MINT mechanism allows only those processes whose integrity labels are dominated by an object read or execute access to it. Additionally, a process may write only to an object with the same integrity. The MINT mechanism is very similar to the MSEN mechanism in having 256 hierarchical levels (the grades) and 65,536 non-hierarchical components (the divisions).</PARAGRAPH>

<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>trap door </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>A hidden software or hardware mechanism that can be triggered to permit system protection mechanisms to be circumvented. It is activated in some innocent-appearing manner; for example, a special &ldquo;random&rdquo; key sequence at a monitor. Software developers often introduce trap doors in their code to enable them to reenter the system and perform certain functions. Synonymous with back door.</PARAGRAPH>

<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>Trojan Horse </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>A computer program with an apparently or actually useful function that contains additional (hidden) functions that surreptitiously exploit the legitimate authorizations of the invoking process to the detriment of security.

</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>trusted computer system </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>&lbreak;A system that employs sufficient hardware and software assurance measures to allow its use for simultaneous processing of a range of sensitive or classified information. A system is trusted when it is believed that it can enforce a particular security policy. A CMW level of trust will provide the user and administrator of a system with a given level of trust in its ability to protect data from disclosure.</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>Trusted Computing Base </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>&lbreak;The totality of protection mechanisms within a computer system, including hardware, firmware, and software, the combination of which is responsible for enforcing a security policy. A TCB consists of one or more components that together enforce a unified security policy over a product or system. The ability of a TCB to enforce correctly a unified security policy depends solely on the mechanisms within the TCB and on the correct input by system administrative personnel of parameters (for example, a user's clearance level) related to the security policy.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Alternatively, this term refers to the set of hardware and software that together enforce the system's security policy. The TCB comprises  only those programs and hardware elements that are known to follow security policy and are considered to be secure. This is necessarily a subset of all the programs available with Trusted IRIX/CMW.</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>trusted distribution </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>&lbreak;A trusted method for distributing the TCB hardware, software, and firmware components, both originals and updates, that protects the TCB from modification during distribution and detects any changes to the TCB that may occur.</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>Trusted IRIX/B</HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>&lbreak;The trademarked name for the trusted operating system that preceded Trusted IRIX/CMW</PARAGRAPH>

</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>trusted path </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>A mechanism by which a person at a system can communicate directly with the TCB. This mechanism can only be activated by the person or the TCB and cannot be imitated by untrusted software.</PARAGRAPH>

<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>worm </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>A virus program that has a very narrow purpose. A worm is designed to track down and eliminate specific data. Unlike a simple virus, which by its very nature is obviously present, a worm is designed to remain unnoticed in order that it may continue its task unchecked. Because it may follow a serpentine path in its hunt for particular data it has earned the nickname &ldquo;worm.&rdquo;</PARAGRAPH>
