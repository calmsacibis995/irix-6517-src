<CHAPTER LBL="7"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="82546">Administering Identification and Authentication</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>In order to ensure that the users on your system are the same people who have been entrusted to use it properly, Identification and Authentication (I&amp;A) requirements have been implemented. Further, in the unlikely event that an individual user breaks a security policy, that user must be held strictly accountable for his or her actions. Holding the owner of a user account responsible for the actions taken with that account is reasonable only if steps have been taken to ensure that the individual using that account is in fact the individual assigned to the account. B1-level systems are required to implement certain facilities to ensure that users are adequately identified and that they authenticate themselves to the system with a password. To log in, the user must know:<INDEXTARGET ID="ch71"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch71|Identification and Authentication --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch72"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch72|accountability --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch73"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch73|user:name --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch74"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch74|authentication --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch75"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch75|password --></PARAGRAPH>

</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>Because these items are all that is needed to gain access to a trusted system, these pieces of information are closely guarded, and created and maintained according to strict procedures outlined in this chapter. Of the two items of information, the most crucial is the account password. The login names are known to many people, or can easily be determined. It is possible to log in without specifying a label if the default label has been set, but the password is absolutely necessary. If a password is compromised or stolen, all information that is available to the user associated with the password is also compromised.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch76"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch76|password:theft --></PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="73170">Administering Passwords</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Passwords are the only mechanism available to authenticate your users. Once Trusted IRIX/CMW has accepted a user's password as valid, that user has access to all files available at his or her clearance for the duration of the login session.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The dangers involved when passwords are compromised cannot be overstated. An intruder can access all files available to the user at any time. Other features of Trusted IRIX/CMW make it likely that an intruder would be swiftly identified and locked out, but a tremendous amount of damage can take place in a short time if the accountability and Identification and Authentication procedures are not followed.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Many features taken for granted in standard IRIX are restricted in Trusted IRIX/CMW. In the area of user passwords, there are facilities to force the user to choose a system-generated password (which is random and difficult to guess). The length of time that this password is valid can be specified (with both a minimum and maximum lifetime), and the encrypted password is not visible to users. When an encrypted password is visible, a potential intruder may copy it and attempt to break the encryption.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch77"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch77|password:aging --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch78"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch78|encrypted password --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch79"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch79|password:encrypted --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Also in Trusted IRIX/CMW, if you choose to allow users to select their own passwords, a strict set of checks are performed on the passwords to disallow passwords without enough variation in the characters used. For example, all passwords must use a combination of letters, numerals, and control characters.</PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="80968">Password Aging</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Trusted IRIX/CMW supports password aging. Password aging is defined as being able to set a minimum and maximum lifetime for passwords. Standard IRIX also supports this feature, and it is described in detail in the guide titled <EXTREF IDREF="97829" BOOK="IA_ConfigOps" FILE="" HDG="97829" INFO="">IRIX Admin: System Configuration and Operation</EXTREF>
.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Password aging is a very useful feature. By limiting the amount of time a password may be in use, you limit the amount of time a potential interloper has to crack the password. By enforcing a minimum password lifetime, you prevent lazy users from simply changing their password briefly and then returning to their usual password immediately.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch710"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch710|password:expiration time --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch711"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch711|password:lifetime --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If a user does not change their password within the specified time period, the user is  forced to change the account password when they next try to log in. Any user can place the following line in  <FILENAME>.login</FILENAME> or <FILENAME>.profile</FILENAME> to notify them when password expiration is imminent: </PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
showpwage <VARIABLE>username</VARIABLE>&space;
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>By default,<COMMAND>&space;showpwage</COMMAND> notifies the user only if the password is within seven days of expiration. This default can be changed with the <CMDLINEOPT>-d</CMDLINEOPT> flag. See the <REFPAGE>showpwage(1)</REFPAGE> reference page for a complete description of this command.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Generally, the only time that an account becomes locked is when the user is away for an extended period of time. But once locked, an account can be unlocked only by the superuser or system administrator. When the account is locked, the encrypted password is replaced by this string: <INDEXTARGET ID="ch712"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch712|locked account --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch713"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch713|login accounts:locked --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch714"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch714|passwords:locked accounts --></PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
*LK* 
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>To unlock the account, the system administrator uses the <COMMAND>dbedit</COMMAND> utility to remove the string from the password field for that account. Then, the system administrator should force the user to choose a new password by executing this command: </PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
passwd -f <VARIABLE>username</VARIABLE>&space;
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>Password aging is enforced for a particular user if his or her encrypted password in the <FILENAME>/etc/shadow</FILENAME> file is followed by a comma and a non-null string of characters from the 64-character alphabet: </PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
. / 0-9 A-Z a-z 
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>The first character of the entry, Maximum, denotes the maximum number of weeks for which a password is valid. A user who attempts to log in after his or her password has expired is forced to change the password. The next character, minimum, denotes the minimum period in weeks that must pass  before the password may be changed. If the second character is omitted, zero weeks is the default minimum. M and m have numerical values in the range 0-63 which correspond to the 64-character alphabet shown above (for example, / = 1 week; z = 63 weeks). If minimum = Maximum = 0 (derived from the string . or ..) the user is forced to change the password at the time of the next login (and the &ldquo;age&rdquo; disappears from the entry in the <FILENAME>/etc/shadow</FILENAME> file). If minimum > Maximum (signified, for example, by the string ./) only the system administrator  can change the password. This is often done for accounts that are used for uucp logins. For example, the following command disallows the user from changing the password:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
passwd -x1 -n10 nuucp 
</EXAMPLE>

<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="60115">Administering Password Generation</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>There are several options available to the security officer when deciding on password generation policy. Trusted IRIX/CMW comes equipped with a default password generation utility, /bin/passwd_gen (installed as <INDEXTARGET ID="ch715"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch715|pronounceable password --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch716"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch716|password:pronounceable --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch717"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch717|random character password --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch718"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch718|password:random character --><FILENAME>passwd_gen.off</FILENAME>), but also allows the individual site to install a custom password generating program. If you have a custom password generator you wish to use, you may replace /bin/passwd_gen with your own program, subject to the following constraints:</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The system administrator is willing to accept the risk of using an unevaluated configuration.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The new program must be placed in the /bin directory and renamed passwd_gen.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The owner of the file must be <ITALICS>root</ITALICS>.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The group of the file must be <ITALICS>sys</ITALICS>.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The DAC permission of the file must be 555 (-r-xr-xr-x).</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The security label of the file must be dblow.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Your system is no longer running the evaluated software configuration.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>Additionally, any custom password generation program must generate a set of passwords on one line, separated by blank spaces.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>To allow password selection, simply log in as the superuser and rename the <FILENAME>/bin/passwd_gen</FILENAME> file.  <INDEXTARGET ID="ch719"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch719|password:chosen --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The default generator presents the user with five selected passwords, and the user is free to accept or reject any of these. If the user does not accept any of the offered passwords, he or she may press the Enter key to obtain a new set of passwords.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If you do not wish to implement password generation at your site, you may remove or rename the passwd_gen program. Once this is done, users are free to select their own passwords, subject to the following triviality checks:</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Each password must have at least six characters. However, only the first eight characters are significant. </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The password must contain at least two alphabet characters and one numeric character. </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The password must not be related to the user's login name. Any reversing or circular shift of the characters in the login name are not allowed. For the purposes of this test, capital letters are assumed to be equivalent to their lowercase counterparts. </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The password must have at least three characters different from the previous password. For the purposes of this test, capital letters are assumed to be equivalent to their lowercase counterparts. </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>Note that if password generation is in effect, the generated passwords are not subject to the above listed triviality checks because more stringent checks are applied internally.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="82518">Password Generator Algorithm</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The Department of Energy requirements for password generators state that all trusted site must have an &ldquo;ADP Security Plan&rdquo; that describes the method of password selection, the length of password, and the size of the password space. To satisfy this requirement for Trusted IRIX/CMW sites, the following information is included in this section.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch720"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch720|DP plan --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch721"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch721|password:ADP plan --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The Trusted IRIX/CMW password generator produces passwords of 7 lowercase alphabet characters in length. The Trusted IRIX/CMW password generator attempts to produce pronounceable passwords, so it produces far fewer than the maximum possible number of passwords. The total password space (the total number of passwords that the generator can possibly produce) is 35,431,196 different passwords. This number is computed based on the size and number of phonemes available for combination into words and the method by which they're combined.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch722"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch722|password:characteristics --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch723"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch723|password:total possible number --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Trusted IRIX/CMW limits the total password guessing rate (for all accounts, on all tty and pty ports) to no more than 1 password per second. This guess rate is not user-configurable. Thus, a person who knew what parameters were used by the password generation program, who had unrestricted access to a Trusted IRIX/CMW system, and who was capable of attempting to log in once per second would be able to guess any password generated by that algorithm in 35,431,196 seconds, which is 410 days of uninterrupted guessing. In 41 days of uninterrupted guessing, the person would have a 10% chance of guessing any password. In 35 seconds, the person would have a &ldquo;one in a million&rdquo; chance of guessing a correct password for a given account. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Of course, it is extremely unlikely that someone attempting to break into a Trusted IRIX/CMW system would know the parameters used to generate passwords, or have unrestricted access to a well-maintained trusted system, so the rate of guessing would necessarily be much lower. If password aging is implemented, requiring users to change their passwords monthly, the chance of a potential intruder correctly guessing a password is negligible.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The password generator relies on a &ldquo;pseudo-random&rdquo; number generator, which is described in the <REFPAGE>random(3)</REFPAGE> reference page.</PARAGRAPH>

However, even if passwords are not required on a particular system, any user who maintains a password on his or her account must enter it at login time.
