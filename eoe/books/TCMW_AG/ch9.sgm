<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="77859">Printing Under Trusted IRIX/CMW</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Printing under the Trusted IRIX/CMW system requires no special resources. Except where noted in this chapter, printing operates exactly as described in your standard IRIX documentation. Trusted IRIX/CMW meets the requirement for B1-level systems for labeled printing. Each page of printed output carries the label of the file printed at the top and bottom of the page. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The system intercepts the output of a print request before it is sent to the printer and ensures that appropriate banner pages and individual page labels are produced.  Line printing under Trusted IRIX/CMW is essentially the same as under standard IRIX, except that printed copy is labeled and fewer printer options are supported. The printer daemon process (see the <REFPAGE>lpsched</REFPAGE><REFPAGE>(8)</REFPAGE> reference page), must be run from the system startup scripts. It can be stopped and restarted while the system is running with the following commands:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
/etc/init.d/lp stop 
/etc/init.d/lp start 
</EXAMPLE>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="16561">Supported Printers</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Trusted IRIX/CMW supports line printing on ASCII (dumb) printers and PostScript printers. The utilities that allow labeled PostScript output, however, are not resistant to label spoofing programs. Because of this weakness, it is up to the individual system administrator to determine whether PostScript printing can be allowed at the site. </PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="73876">Labeling Printer Output</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>This section defines the methods implemented to properly label printed output. There are several parts to the printing system:  the print job submission program, the program that produces the output (in the case of PostScript), and the program that labels the output. </PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>PostScript Printer Output</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>PostScript requires a print job to be written in the PostScript definition language. This language specifies the parameters and specifics of the printout. Trusted IRIX/CMW has implemented a filter to this output production program that attaches labels to the individual page specifications and creates an appropriately labeled banner page. </PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>ASCII Printer Output</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>ASCII printers rely on escape sequences within the print stream to provide directions to the printer. Trusted IRIX/CMW has implemented a filter for ASCII print jobs that inserts the labels into the print stream.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Printing Software</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Trusted IRIX/CMW has implemented the <COMMAND>lp</COMMAND> and <COMMAND>pr</COMMAND> utilities to produce labeled printer output. Using the information supplied here, the system administrator can extend support to other printers. Printing interface utilities under UNIX are usually in the form of shell scripts that are invoked by the<COMMAND>&space;lp</COMMAND> command. The usual MAC policies are implemented around printing requests. The print request inherits the label of the file being printed, and this label is used to control access to the print job. For example, MAC must be satisfied in order to cancel the print job or to call up the job on the printer spooler queue. When printing on an ASCII printer, the print job is sent through the <COMMAND>pr</COMMAND> filter program with the <CMDLINEOPT>-b</CMDLINEOPT> option in order to filter out escape sequences and apply the internal page labels. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Other optional arguments to the <REFPAGE>pr</REFPAGE> program are <CMDLINEOPT>-l</CMDLINEOPT> and <CMDLINEOPT>-f</CMDLINEOPT>, followed by the filename and the name of the type of printer. </PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="39249">Magnetic Tape Backups</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>One of the most important responsibilities of the system administrator is that of preventive maintenance. It is very important to create frequent backups of all files on the system. It is far less painful to recover a system whose files are a day old than it is to start from scratch. If you back up your entire filesystem at least weekly and back up changed files every day, you can maintain a reasonable assurance that the data contained on your backups is uncorrupted and current. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The original distribution media for your system should always be stored in a safe place.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>After your trusted software is installed and configured, but before you allow users to begin work, make a complete backup of your system using <REFPAGE>tar</REFPAGE> and make a record of all your system files, their attributes and a checksum, and store this backup with your distribution media. With this record and the original tapes you should be able to recreate your system if needed. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Backups should be done by the individual users in a workstation environment or by the system administrator if a server is used. The specific backup practices at any given site should be approved by the system administrator. The tape device for the Trusted IRIX/CMW system  (<FILENAME>/dev/tape</FILENAME>) is shipped with an exact label. The system administrator must change this label each time a user at a different label wishes to use the tape device.</PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="40936">tar Backups Under Trusted IRIX/CMW</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>B1 systems are required to provide for labeled tape backups. Trusted IRIX/CMW meets this requirement by providing the new M keyword to the <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND> command. This keyword directs <COMMAND>tar </COMMAND>to maintain the security labels on all files placed on the tape. To recover files from backup, use <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND> with the <KEYWORD>M</KEYWORD> keyword. Always remember that it is still possible to make unlabeled backups using <REFPAGE>tar</REFPAGE> without the <KEYWORD>M</KEYWORD> keyword. Also, using <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND> to extract labeled files without the <KEYWORD>M</KEYWORD> keyword results in the loss of label data. It is therefore strongly recommended that access to the physical tape device and possession of magnetic tapes be limited to the system administrator. Even though <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND> maintains labeling on the tape, the act of making a tape is still subject to MAC. Assuming that <ITALICS>root</ITALICS> makes the system backups, <ITALICS>root</ITALICS> should follow this procedure for system backups:</PARAGRAPH>
<ORDEREDLIST><LIST><PARAGRAPH>Make sure that <ITALICS>root</ITALICS> has read privilege to all directories and files. </PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>Use the <COMMAND>chlabel</COMMAND> command to change the label of the tape device to match your label.</PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>Change directories to the directory you wish to back up.</PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>Enter the following command to begin the backup:</PARAGRAPH>
<CODE>
tar cvM . 
</CODE>
</LIST>
<LIST><PARAGRAPH>Write the highest label on your system on the surface of the tape cartridge, so it is not inadvertently made available or discarded. </PARAGRAPH>
</LIST>
</ORDEREDLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>Recovering files in this manner is the reverse of removal. You must make certain that the tape device is properly labeled and then you can restore files using the tape you made previously. If all the files in a directory are known to be at a single label, you can log in with sufficient clearance and change the label of the tape device to match the directory label and make a single level backup. You should still use the <KEYWORD>M</KEYWORD> keyword to <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND>, however, to maintain the label information. Also, write the label of the information on the tape on the surface of the tape cartridge. </PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="27234">Remote Tape Drives</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>A program called <COMMAND>/etc/rmt</COMMAND> in the Trusted IRIX/CMW system allows you to use the remote tape drive feature of <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND>. The <FILENAME>/etc/rmt</FILENAME> file is distributed with the label binary.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>To use the remote tape drive features of <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND> over a Monolabel network connection, you must change the label of <COMMAND>/etc/rmt</COMMAND> to match the label of your Monolabel network.</PARAGRAPH>
