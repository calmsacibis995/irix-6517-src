<PARAGRAPH>&ldquo;About This Guide&rdquo; includes brief descriptions of the contents of this guide and an explanation of typographical conventions used, and refers you to additional sources of information you might find helpful.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>This guide explains how to perform general system configuration and operation tasks under the Trusted IRIX/CMW (Compartmented Mode Workstation) operating system used with Silicon Graphics workstations and servers. It provides descriptions of those tasks that are specific to this version of the operating system.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If you have a graphics workstation, you may find it convenient to use the System Manager, which is described in the&space;<INDEXTARGET ID="preface1"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: preface1|Personal System Administration Guide --><DOCTITLE>Personal System Administration Guide</DOCTITLE>. That guide should be your first resource for administering graphics workstations. Regardless of whether you use the System Manager or the IRIX command-line interface, the results are the same. The System Manager does not create any new files on your system.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If you have a server, the&space;<INDEXTARGET ID="preface2"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: preface2|system administration manuals --><DOCTITLE>IRIX Admin</DOCTITLE>&space;manual set (of which this guide is part) is your primary guide to system administration, because without graphics you cannot use the System Manager. This guide does not describe the System Manager in great detail. Instead, it covers the traditional shell command approach to administering an IRIX operating system.<INDEXTARGET ID="preface3"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: preface3|IRIX Admin manuals --><INDEXTARGET ID="preface4"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: preface4|System Manager --></PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>How to Use This Guide</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The <DOCTITLE>Trusted IRIX/CMW Security Administration Guide </DOCTITLE>is written for administrators who are responsible for performing tasks beyond the reasonable scope of ``end users'' on Trusted IRIX/CMW systems. Frequently, people who would consider themselves end users find themselves performing advanced administrative tasks. This book has been prepared to help both the new and experienced administrator successfully perform all operations necessary to configure and maintain CMW security on Trusted IRIX/CMW systems. It is hoped that people who considered themselves end users in the past will, by using this book, gain experience and confidence in successfully performing advanced system administration tasks. </PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Target Audience of This Guide</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>This guide is intended for administrators who are responsible for one or more systems running the Trusted IRIX/CMW operating system beyond the usual user responsibility for the user's home directory structure and immediate working directories. This guide and its companion administration guides have been written to provide directions for</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>those who find themselves in the position of maintaining Trusted IRIX/CMW systems for themselves and others and who require more information about IRIX commands and system and network expertise.</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Reference Pages</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The IRIX reference pages (often called &ldquo;man&rdquo; or &ldquo;manual&rdquo; pages) provide concise reference information on the use of IRIX commands, subroutines, and other elements that make up the IRIX operating system. This collection of entries is one of the most important references for an administrator. Generally, each reference page covers one command, although some reference pages cover several closely related commands. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The IRIX reference pages are available online through the <COMMAND>man</COMMAND> command. To view a reference page, use the <DOCTITLE>man</DOCTITLE> command at the shell prompt. For example, to see the reference page for <COMMAND>diff</COMMAND>, enter</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
<USERINPUT>man diff</USERINPUT>&space;
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>It is a good practice to print those reference pages you consistently use for reference and those you are likely to need before major administrative operations and keep them in a notebook of some kind. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Each command, system file, or other system object is described on a separate page. The reference pages are divided into seven sections, as shown in <XREF IDREF="63924" TYPE="TEXT">Table&nbsp;i</XREF>. When referring to reference pages, this document follows a standard UNIX convention: the name of the command is followed by its section number in parentheses. For example, <INDEXTARGET ID="preface8"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: preface8|man pages --><INDEXTARGET ID="preface9"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: preface9|help:reference --><INDEXTARGET ID="preface10"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: preface10|<ITALICS>man</ITALICS> command --><COMMAND>cc</COMMAND> refers to the <REFPAGE>cc(1)</REFPAGE> reference page in Section 1. </PARAGRAPH>
