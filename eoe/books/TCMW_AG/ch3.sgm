<CHAPTER LBL="3"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="44892">Administering Login Accounts</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Two classes of login accounts are found under Trusted IRIX/CMW: user accounts and administrative accounts. The administrative accounts are <INDEXTARGET ID="ch31"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch31|maintaining login accounts --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch32"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch32|user:accounts --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch33"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch33|login accounts --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch34"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch34|account:user --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch35"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch35|login accounts:maintaining --><ITALICS>root</ITALICS> (the system administrator) and<ITALICS>&space;auditor</ITALICS> (the auditor). All other accounts are ordinary user accounts. Administrative accounts are discussed in the section "Planning Your System Administration" in Chapter 2. This chapter discusses the appropriate use and management of user accounts. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>User accounts are both the first line of defense of a trusted system and potentially the weakest link in that system. Every user account can break system security if it is not managed well, and every user account can be used to enforce system security. The way your user accounts are managed is crucial to a successful secure system.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Users must have ready access to the files and resources they need to perform their work. If this access is not available or is inconvenient, users circumvent the security policies and create threats to system security. However, users should also not be allowed access to unnecessary files and resources, because this is a security threat in itself.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Guidelines for effective secure management of user accounts are explained in this chapter. Procedures for administering user accounts and user groups are also presented.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch36"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch36|user accounts:managing --></PARAGRAPH>

<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Always use a different account name and user ID number for each user on your system. Each account should represent only one person, for accountability.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch38"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch38|guidelines:for user accounts --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch39"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch39|user:account guidelines --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch310"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch310|account:guidelines --></PARAGRAPH>

</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Never assign a login name that begins with a number. Some networks do not interpret these login names correctly.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Always choose unique user identification names for your users. For example, the login name <ITALICS>steveb</ITALICS> is a better choice than <ITALICS>user001</ITALICS>. A login name and the other information associated with an account should always be readily associated with the person who owns that account. It is generally possible to find distinguishing personal characteristics to differentiate between two or more users with similar names.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Include the user's full name and some personal identification, such as job title and phone number, in the comment field of the <FILENAME>/etc/passwd</FILENAME> file. Be careful, however, not to include classified information in the <FILENAME>/etc/passwd</FILENAME> file.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>When you create user accounts, be certain that the user's environment is properly initialized for security. For example, in the&space;.<FILENAME>profile</FILENAME> or .<FILENAME>cshrc</FILENAME> files, set the user's UMASK to 077. This initializes the default DAC permissions to allow the user to access only those files he or she creates.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>In the .<ITALICS>profile</ITALICS> or .<ITALICS>cshrc</ITALICS> files, set the PATH environment variable to include only those directories that the user is allowedto access. Also, in the PATH variable, make certain that the user's home directory is searched last, after the system directories, for commands. This guards against some forms of Trojan Horse attack. Do not include any temporary or public directories in the PATH, such as <ITALICS>/tmp</ITALICS>.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>If possible, place a copy of the security policy in each account.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>When you remove a user account, first make a backup tape of all files in the home directory belonging to that account.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>When you remove a user account, assign new owners to any files on the system still owned by the removed user.</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Creating User Accounts</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>This section gives directions on creating user accounts. Before beginning the process, choose the user's login name, user ID number, allowable security labels (or label ranges), and any administrative roles.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch314"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch314|user accounts:creating --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>On a trusted system, shadow passwords (<FILENAME>/etc/shadow</FILENAME>) are always used; see the  <REFPAGE>pwconv</REFPAGE>(1)  reference page. When MAC is installed, every user must have an entry in <FILENAME>/etc/clearance</FILENAME>. All of these databases, except <FILENAME>/etc/passwd</FILENAME>, are protected from perusal by nonprivileged users.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>It is important to follow the procedures exactly as they are specified in this guide. These procedures often involve manipulating sensitive system access files. Failure to follow the exact procedures listed here could leave your system without the designed security protections. <INDEXTARGET ID="ch315"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch315|accounts:adding --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch316"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch316|new user account --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch317"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch317|user:account adding --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch318"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch318|account:adding a user --></PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>Group your users based on their common needs. Put all the users on a given project in the same group. All members of a group acquire the group ID in addition to their user ID when they log in.
