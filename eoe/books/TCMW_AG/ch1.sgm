<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="85292">What Is a Trusted System</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Operating systems that attempt to provide a secure environment for the development and storage of sensitive information are known as trusted systems. In an abstract sense, no system is ever perfectly secure from harm, so we use the term trusted rather than secure. A trusted system can be thought of as any system that fits the following criteria:<INDEXTARGET ID="ch11"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch11|definition:of a trusted system --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch12"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch12|trust:definition --></PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The system allows all users to do their ordinary and necessary work without difficulty.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The system enforces the security policy deemed by the management to be appropriate to the site.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>The first criterion is the most important. If users are unable to do their ordinary and necessary work, they either will circumvent the security measures or they will not use the system at all. In either case, the trusted system is rendered useless. Many users are concerned that they will not be able to do their work in a trusted environment. A good site administration plan structures  a trusted system so that the user is relatively unaffected by its functioning. Ideally, users should be able to perform all their tasks and see the trusted features of the operating system only when necessary.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The second criterion requires that the system have adequate security features to enforce the site security policy set forth by the management. Trusted IRIX/CMW  offers a variety of security measures that are sufficient to satisfy most sites. These measures are as follows:</PARAGRAPH>
<HANGLIST><HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>Access Control Lists</HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>  &lbreak;An Access Control List allows the owner of a file or directory to make a specific list of users and user groups and the specific permissions each one is allowed to the file or directory. ACLs are a standard feature of IRIX.</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>Auditing</HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>The audit subsystem allows the system administrator to keep a precise log of all system activity.  Auditing is a standard feature of IRIX. </PARAGRAPH>

</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>Capability-based Privilege Mechanism</HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>&lbreak;This is the mechanism through which a privilege is determined based on the set of effective capabilities in a process.

</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>Mandatory Integrity</HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>&lbreak;This is a part of the Mandatory Access Control mechanism that covers an integrity requirement. It allows the system administrator to limit the ability of highly trusted users to access files and programs that are not absolutely secure and trusted. </PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="38761">Why Use a Trusted System</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The Trusted IRIX/CMW system is designed to address the three fundamental issues of computer security: policy, accountability, and assurance. By fully addressing these areas, the system becomes a trustworthy base for secure development and business. Because the nature of a trusted system is already constrained, little must be trusted beyond the system itself. When you run your application programs on the system, you have a reasonable certainty that your applications will be free from corruption and safe from intruders.  <INDEXTARGET ID="ch13"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch13|security:policy --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch14"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch14|accountability --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch15"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch15|assurance --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>CMW stands for Compartmented Mode Workstation, which means that your individual windows and processes running simultaneously need not all be at the same MAC label. This "compartmentalization" of windows and processes adds greatly to the usability of the system. In all other ways, the system conforms to standard TCSEC B3 feature set, but with assurance of security at the B1 level.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The most important security aspect of the system is a clear definition of the site security policy with respect to all the trusted system features listed above. To accomplish this, all system objects have been examined and altered to close potential security holes and determine a basic clearance level. This examination and revision process ensures the integrity and security of the distributed system.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Another highly important security aspect is assurance. A secure system design must be inspected and approved by a competent agency. Trusted IRIX/CMW from Silicon Graphics is under evaluation for the B1 security rating from the NCSC and Trusted IRIX/B version 4.0.5/epl has been successfully evaluated at the B1 level.  IRIX  is under evaluation for the C2 security rating.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The NCSC has set out evaluation criteria for trusted systems. Trusted IRIX/CMW supports all of the features required for a B3 rating and the assurance requirements for a B1 rating.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch16"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch16|B1:requirements --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch17"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch17|NCSC:requirements --></PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="50916">Why Use Trusted IRIX/CMW</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Trusted IRIX/CMW is a significant improvement over conventional trusted operating systems derived from the standard UNIX kernel. While secure operating systems necessarily compartmentalize user interactions, the system need not be hostile to the average  or even novice user.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Trusted IRIX/CMW is fully integrated with standard IRIX. IRIX is the Silicon Graphics implementation of the UNIX System V Operating System. Trusted IRIX/CMW is an add-on, developed to conform to the functional requirements set forth in the U.S. National Computer Security Center (NCSC) Orange Book for an A1-level trusted operating system. Trusted IRIX/CMW will be evaluated at the assurance level as a B1 system.  The Orange Book is a common name for the 5200.28-STD Department of Defense Trusted Computer Systems Evaluation Criteria. <INDEXTARGET ID="ch18"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch18|NCSC:Orange Book --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch19"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch19|NCSC:TCSEC --></PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Ease of Use</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>As a modified version of an existing operating system, many of the underlying features of Trusted IRIX/CMW have withstood the test of time. Designing a system that promoted &ldquo;ease of use&rdquo; was a paramount consideration in the creation of IRIX. Silicon Graphics has a firm commitment to &ldquo;visual computing,&rdquo; evidenced in the graphical tools provided to you in the IRIX environment.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Greater User-Friendliness</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Part and parcel of our commitment to ease of use is our commitment to &ldquo;user-friendliness.&rdquo; A consistent and logical framework underlies the design of Silicon Graphics visual desktop tools. This design permits even the novice user to move about the operating system with some confidence. The desktop provides a visual representation of the filesystem and allows you to navigate using the mouse alone.</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="22039">Trusted IRIX/CMW Security Features</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The distinguishing difference between trusted systems and nontrusted systems is the security-enhanced feature set. For CMW-level systems, this feature set includes three main components. These components are improved identification and authentication of users, auditing, object reuse, and access control (MAC and DAC).<INDEXTARGET ID="ch111"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch111|B1:feature set --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>As well as the required feature set, Silicon Graphics has implemented the X Window System and networking services for the trusted environment. Each component feature is described in detail in this section.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Every trusted system has a Trusted Computing Base (TCB). The TCB is the system hardware, the operating system program itself, and the commands, utilities, tools, and system files that are known to be secure. This set of hardware, files, and programs is the &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; part of a trusted system.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch112"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch112|Trusted Computing Base --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch113"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch113|TCB --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Within the TCB, there are subjects and objects. A subject is any active force on the system, such as a user's shell process, or the audit daemon, or the operating system itself. An object is any passive resource on the system, such as a text file, a page of memory, or a piece of system hardware.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Trusted IRIX/CMW is fully configurable to your site's needs. You are free to select your own security clearances, your own capabilities and access control lists, and your own system of password protection. </PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="99032">Identification and Authentication</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The Identification and Authentication  (I&amp;A) mechanism controls user access to the system. In common terms, the I&amp;A mechanism is the login procedure. This subsystem is always active if the system is running, and it is impossible to have any contact with the system without first logging in through the I&amp;A system.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The improved I&amp;A facilities of Trusted IRIX/CMW allow the administrator to be certain that the people on the system are authorized users and that private password integrity is maintained to the highest possible levels.</PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Passwords Under Trusted IRIX/CMW </TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Under Trusted IRIX/CMW, encrypted passwords are stored separately from other user identification information. This separate location is hidden from normal user access, so the process of a systematic &ldquo;dictionary encryption&rdquo; hunt for a password is precluded. User clearance information is also stored in a hidden or shadow file. Under Trusted IRIX/CMW, the <INDEXTARGET ID="ch114"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch114|password:encrypted --><FILENAME>/etc/passwd </FILENAME>file does not contain the encrypted password; only the shadow password file contains that information.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>In response to extensions to the CMW requirements, passwords can be generated automatically for the users under Trusted IRIX/CMW. The system administrator can configure the system to require this feature for every password change, or it can be an option for the user. The complexity, length, and character combinations required of passwords can also be configured. For example, it is possible to require users to mix control characters into their passwords. It is also possible to check and reject passwords that can be found in a dictionary, proper names, place names, and technical words associated with computers or the current project. System administrators can also require passwords to be changed regularly.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch115"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch115|password:generation --></PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Multilevel Login </TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Individual users may have a range of security levels available that have been predetermined by the administrator. The user is not always required to log in at the highest assigned level, thus allowing the flexibility to log in at a level appropriate for a given task. After a successful login has been established, the user may change the clearance of his or her process during the course of the login session. When this happens, all open file descriptors are closed and all objects cleared to prevent declassification or violation of the security policy. All changes of clearance are audited.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch116"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch116|multilevel login --></PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="68684">Mandatory Access Control</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Mandatory Access Control (MAC) allows the administrator to set up policies and accounts that will allow each user to have full access to the files and resources he or she needs, but not to other information and resources not immediately necessary to perform assigned tasks. The access control is called &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; because the system does not allow the owner of the files  to change the security classification of system objects. Also, under MAC, access permission cannot be passed from one user to another, as under traditional UNIX systems, which use only Discretionary Access Control (DAC). Trusted IRIX/CMW includes both MAC and DAC, which work together to precisely control system access.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch117"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch117|Mandatory Access Control. See MAC --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch118"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch118|MAC: definition --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Under Trusted IRIX/CMW, MAC is divided into two interrelated subsystems: Mandatory Sensitivity and Mandatory Integrity. The access-control enhancements to Trusted IRIX/CMW allow the administrator to set up levels of clearance and related categories of files and other resources, and to assign each user a clearance (or range of clearances). Through this system of access controls, the administrator can custom tailor a user's environment so that the particular user has access only to those files and resources he or she needs to complete required tasks. If there is  a breach into that user's account, the unauthorized user has access to very little of the site's protected information.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Each label used for access control has two parts: the sensitivity label and the integrity label. <INDEXTARGET ID="ch119"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch119|labels:components --><XREF IDREF="72578" TYPE="GRAPHIC">Figure&nbsp;1-1</XREF> shows the components of a label.</PARAGRAPH>

</FIGURE>
</PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Sensitivity Label Components </TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Sensitivity labels define the &ldquo;secretness&rdquo; or &ldquo;classification&rdquo; of files and resources and the clearance level of users. A sensitivity label is composed of a sensitivity level and possibly some number of sensitivity categories.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch120"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch120|labels:sensitivity --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>There are 256 hierarchical sensitivity levels available for the administrator to create security classifications. In a commercial environment, this label attribute could be used to classify, for example, levels of a management hierarchy. Each file or program has one hierarchical sensitivity level. A user may be allowed to use several different levels, but only one level may be used at any given time.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Over 65,000 sensitivity categories are available for files and programs. For example, categories could include information sorted by subject matter such as geography, demography, astronomy, and others. Each file or user can be a member of any number of categories or of no categories.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Integrity Label Components </TITLE><PARAGRAPH>While the sensitivity labels identify whether a user is cleared to view certain information, integrity labels identify whether data is reliable enough for a specific user to see. An integrity label is composed of an integrity grade and some number of integrity divisions.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch121"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch121|labels:integrity --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>There are 256 hierarchical grades to classify the reliability of information. For example, data could be classified as an unreliable rumor or as an absolute, confirmed fact.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>There are over 65,000 divisions available to classify information based on its source. The source implies probable integrity of the data. For example, sources of data could be divided into <ITALICS>Canadian Government</ITALICS>, <ITALICS>U.S. Government</ITALICS>, <ITALICS>CBS News</ITALICS>, <ITALICS>Hearst Publications</ITALICS>, and others. In the commercial environment, data sources could be divided into <ITALICS>Trade Shows</ITALICS>, <ITALICS>Press Releases</ITALICS>, <ITALICS>Conversational</ITALICS>, <ITALICS>Dataquest</ITALICS>, and the like.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Label Name Aliases </TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Label names are configurable so that specific sites can control naming conventions to meet their special requirements. For example, the site administrator has control of name length (within limits) and could use non-English names, if desired.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch122"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch122|label names --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Users should only use labels that have label name aliases associated with them. A user who wishes to use a label without a name should request the system administrator to add one. The non-aliased representation of labels can be both verbose and confusing, leading to possible mishandling by the unwary.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch123"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch123|labels:label names aliases --></PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>MAC Protected Passwords </TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Encrypted passwords and user clearance data are under mandatory access controls that prohibit access by nonadministrators.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="50244">Discretionary Access Control</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Trusted IRIX/CMW supports the POSIX P1003.1e Draft16 definition for Access Control Lists (ACLs). This draft standard provides for traditional file permission bits working in concert with the more versatile ACLs. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) permissions are defined by the user who owns the file in question. For example, if a user has a personal file in his or her home directory, that user can set the DAC permissions to allow no other users on the system to view, copy, or edit that file. Default DAC permissions for newly created files are set via the <INDEXTARGET ID="ch124"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch124|DAC:POSIX standard --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch125"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch125|Discretionary Access Control. See DAC --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch126"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch126|DAC --><COMMAND>umask</COMMAND> command. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Thus, to gain access to a file that was created by another user, a user must not only have the proper MAC clearance, but must have set the DAC permissions on the file to allow others to access it. DAC permissions should be set in accordance with site security policies.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Default DAC permissions for newly created files depend on the <COMMAND>umask</COMMAND> and on any default ACL entries found in the containing directory.  </PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Access Control Lists</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Access Control Lists (ACLs) allow users to specify on a user-by-user basis who may access their files and directories. The purpose of this feature is to provide a finer level of control than is  allowed through traditional discretionary access control.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="98931">System Audit Trail</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>A foundation of Trusted IRIX/CMW is the <ITALICS>system audit trail</ITALICS>. The system audit trail provides a means for the system administrator to oversee each important event taking place on the system. The audit trail is useful for tracking changes in sensitive files and programs and for identifying inappropriate use of the system.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch127"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch127|system audit trail:description --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The audit trail is generated by additional code in the operating system kernel that notes specific important events, such as file creation, file changes, file removal, invocation of programs, and the login and logout events.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The audit subsystem allows the administrator to create a dynamic record of the system's activity. This record allows the administrator to hold each user strictly accountable for his or her actions. The audit system is completely configurable at any time by the audit administrator.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Audit information must be carefully gathered and protected so that actions affecting security can be traced to the responsible party. Trusted IRIX/CMW records the occurrences of security-relevant events in an audit log. For each event audited, the system records the date and time of the event, the initiating user, the type of event, the success or failure of the event, and the name and security classification of the files or programs used.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The auditing process is transparent to the user.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="77224">Object Reuse Policy</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>To preclude accidental disclosure of data, display memory and long-term data storage are subject to an object reuse policy and implementation. For example, all system memory is always automatically cleared before it is allocated to another program. Surrendered disk space is also cleaned before it is reallocated.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch128"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch128|object reuse --></PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION2>
</SECTION1>
<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="13001">TSIX Session Manager</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The purpose of trusted networking is to properly label data that is imported or exported from the system, and to appropriately enforce the system security policy on that data.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The TSIX standard was created to allow various trusted operating system vendors to  interoperate.  Under TSIX networking, labeling occurs at two levels.  At the network level, IP Security Options (RIPSO or CIPSO) are used to route traffic.  At the session manager level, SAMP and SATMP are used to send all the security attributes required to enforce security policy between systems on the network.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch129"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch129|TSIX Session Manager: standard --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The system administrator implements  the level of networking support available at the  site. Some sites may have a very open networking environment with full connection to Trusted IRIX/CMW machines, while others may not allow any connection between trusted and untrusted systems, or even between trusted systems. Each site  implementation will be unique.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION1>
<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="30355">Data Import/Export Restrictions</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>NCSC B-level security standards indicate that label information must be preserved when files are placed on magnetic storage media such as tapes. Trusted IRIX/CMW has modified the <COMMAND>tar</COMMAND> command and the <COMMAND>cpio</COMMAND> command to include the <KEYWORD>M</KEYWORD> keyword, to maintain label information on tape media.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Additionally, CMW standards specify that all paper output must be marked with the label of the information printed. Trusted IRIX/CMW line printer software has been modified to add this feature. <INDEXTARGET ID="ch130"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch130|B1:printing --></PARAGRAPH>
