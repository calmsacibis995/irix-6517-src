<CHAPTER LBL="10"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="39027">Maintaining an Evaluated Configuration</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>If you intend to run the evaluated configuration of the Trusted IRIX/CMWsystem at your site, you should be aware that there are strict limits placed on the hardware and software that have been evaluated. This chapter defines the evaluated configuration. If anything is added to, modified in, or subtracted from the evaluated configuration as described in this chapter, you are no longer running the evaluated configuration. Your system may operate normally, but the configuration has not been tested for security.</PARAGRAPH>
