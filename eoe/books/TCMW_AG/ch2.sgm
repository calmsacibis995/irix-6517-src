<CHAPTER LBL="2"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="94635">Planning Your Trusted IRIX/CMW System</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Before installing the Trusted IRIX/CMW system, spend some time defining your needs and examining and classifying the various types of information and applications that will reside on your system. Although it is always possible to reconfigure and change your system resources and practices, your installation will benefit from planning. A &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; of your trusted system is often beneficial before classified data and users are allowed access.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch21"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch21|planning:for your trusted system --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>This chapter describes the planning necessary to ensure a trouble-free and efficient trusted system implementation. If you do not plan your system, you are likely to forget to implement some necessary security policies or labels. While the system is fully configurable at any time, it is inconvenient to have to search through your system and fix existing files and user accounts. Time spent in planning will be much shorter than time spent in repairing and updating.</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>This section explains the privilege environments (augmented superuser and no superuser) in which the administrator works and the privilege mechanisms (superuser-based and capability-based) used, and provides information on the administrator and auditor logins plus tasks they perform on a trusted system.</PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="34308">Privilege Environments</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The IRIX system allows many users to work on the same system without interfering with each other or obtaining unauthorized access to each other's work. To accomplish this, the IRIX system defines certain restrictions on the actions of users. These restrictions create an environment in which users can confidently do their work without concern about the safety of sensitive data or loss of system availability.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The restrictions that prevent users from interfering with or inappropriately obtaining the work of others, however, must sometimes be overridden by administrators or system software. The ability to override restrictions is called <ITALICS>privilege<INDEXTARGET ID="ch22"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch22|definition:of privilege --></ITALICS>. The means by which the system determines, grants, propagates, and controls privilege is called a <ITALICS>privilege mechanism,<INDEXTARGET ID="ch23"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch23|privilege:mechanism --></ITALICS> and the set of privilege mechanisms configured for a given system is called that system's <ITALICS>privilege environment<INDEXTARGET ID="ch24"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch24|privilege: environment --></ITALICS>.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The IRIX system provides two privilege mechanisms:</PARAGRAPH>
<HANGLIST><HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>Superuser-based privilege mechanism </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH> &lbreak;The superuser-based privilege mechanism is the traditional UNIX privilege mechanism. In this mechanism, a process with a user ID of 0 (<INDEXTARGET ID="ch25"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch25|superuser-based privilege mechanism --><ITALICS>root</ITALICS>) has unlimited privilege. When that process executes a command, the process retains the root user ID and, therefore, unlimited privilege. No user ID other than root confers privilege within the superuser-based privilege mechanism.</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>Capability-based privilege mechanism </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH> &lbreak;The capability-based privilege mechanism is an IRIX refinement. In this mechanism, user IDs do not themselves confer any privilege. Instead, privilege derives from <INDEXTARGET ID="ch26"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch26|capability-based privilege mechanism --><ITALICS>capabilities</ITALICS>. A <INDEXTARGET ID="ch27"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch27|definition:of capability --><ITALICS>capability</ITALICS> is a discrete unit of privilege that overrides a set of related system restrictions (see the <REFPAGE>capabilities(4)</REFPAGE> reference page). There is no overlap between the set of restrictions overridden by one capability and the set of restrictions overridden by another capability.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The system may assign capabilities to a user when he or she logs in, based on an entry in the user capability database (see the capability(4) reference page). These capabilities are then available for inheritance by authorized commands. When a process executes a command, the process gets a new set of capabilities. These capabilities are computed from the capabilities presented for inheritance by the process, the authorization of the command to inherit those capabilities, and a set of extra capabilities granted directly to the command itself upon execution. For more detailed information on process and file capabilities see the <REFPAGE>capabilities(4)</REFPAGE> reference page.</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
</HANGLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>You use these two privilege mechanisms to configure your IRIX system for one of two privilege environments:</PARAGRAPH>
<HANGLIST><HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>Augmented Superuser </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH> &lbreak;The augmented superuser privilege environment is a combination of the superuser-based privilege mechanism and the capability-based privilege mechanism. In this environment, an administrator logged in as root (user ID of 0) has unlimited, universally inherited privilege. Therefore, the administrator must be careful when executing commands to use only known commands and processes that are appropriate to the task at hand. Use of an untrusted command by the root user could grant unlimited privilege to a Trojan Horse program (a program designed to usurp access rights or privilege while performing an otherwise useful and apparently benign function).<INDEXTARGET ID="ch28"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch28|augmented superuser privilege environment --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Note that while the superuser-based privilege mechanism grants root unlimited privilege, that privilege does not take the form of capabilities. Capability assignment and inheritance is not affected in any way by the user ID of the process.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The augmented superuser privilege environment also employs the capability-based privilege mechanism. This allows nonroot processes to obtain privilege through specific assignment of inheritance of capabilities. The IRIX system does not automatically assign capabilities to users other than <ITALICS>root</ITALICS> (the system administrator) and <ITALICS>auditor</ITALICS> (the auditor). The IRIX system does, however, assign capabilities to certain nonadministrative commands and daemons. This allows fine control of privilege within these commands when they are executed by a nonroot process.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The augmented superuser privilege environment most closely resembles the traditional UNIX privilege environment. It allows administration without specific concern for capabilities and capability inheritance. The advantage is simple administration and administrative flexibility. The disadvantage is the relative ease with which an administrator or system programmer can make a mistake that results in a security failure.</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>No Superuser </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH> &lbreak;The no-superuser privilege environment contains only the capability-based privilege mechanism. In this environment the system administrator account is still <INDEXTARGET ID="ch29"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch29|no-superuser privilege environment --><ITALICS>root</ITALICS> and the auditor account is still <ITALICS>auditor</ITALICS>, but root no longer derives privilege from its user ID. Instead, all privilege derives from capabilities.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The no-superuser privilege environment yields the greatest protection from administrative error and Trojan Horse attack. It does, however, limit privilege to the set of commands authorized for capabilities, which may not include all commands that need privilege at your site. Also, it limits administrative flexibility by constraining administrators to commands that can inherit capabilities.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The advantage of the no-superuser privilege environment is enhanced assurance that privilege will not be abused or usurped. The disadvantage is somewhat increased administrative complexity and decreased administrative flexibility.</PARAGRAPH>

</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>In addition to defining and maintaining policy, the system administrator also performs day-to-day maintenance tasks that do not require special privilege, ensures system availability, and manages the resources and services provided to the user community.</PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Administrator login</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The system administrator is <INDEXTARGET ID="ch213"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch213|administrator:login --><ITALICS>root</ITALICS>, regardless of the privilege environment on your system. In the no-superuser privilege environment, the system administrator derives privilege from the <FILENAME>/etc/capability</FILENAME> file, specifically the capability setting for <ITALICS>root</ITALICS>:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
root:all=:all+eip
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>This allows a user who can log in as <ITALICS>root</ITALICS> to specify any set of capabilities at login, as follows:</PARAGRAPH>
<EXAMPLE>
Login: root CAP=all+eip
</EXAMPLE>
<PARAGRAPH>Unless the capabilities are specified at login, <ITALICS>root</ITALICS> has no privilege in a no-superuser privilege environment.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>In an augmented superuser privilege environment, <ITALICS>root</ITALICS> may also log in and specify capabilities, but this is not necessary because the <ITALICS>root</ITALICS> user ID automatically confers superuser privilege.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If MAC is installed, the system administrator must pay careful attention to MAC labels. The administrator can log in at any user MAC label and several system MAC labels. The reasons for choosing a given MAC label and the risks associated with operation at each MAC label are described as follows.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>User MAC Labels</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The system administrator usually logs in at a user label to manipulate data at that label without concern about accidentlly creating an incorrectly labeled file. While this reduces the risk of accidental declassification, it does not eliminate this risk unless the system administrator also avoids MAC related capabilities at login. In the augmented superuser privilege environment, the system administrator cannot use capabilities to limit privilege, so the administrator must still be careful.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Private Database Label (dbadmin)</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Certain system databases and log files are protected from modification and observation using the <ITALICS>dbadmin</ITALICS> MAC label. To view these databases and log files without accidentally disclosing their contents, the system administrator is encouraged to log in at dbadmin. In the no-superuser privileged environment, the system administrator can further protect against accidental disclosure by avoiding MAC related capabilities. This is not possible in the augmented superuser privilege environment.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch214"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch214|dbadmin:label --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Another reason for logging in at <ITALICS>dbadmin</ITALICS> is to modify private databases. Because the label on a private database is designed to protect it from disclosure, using privilege to edit such a database at a different label creates the risk of accidentally compromising security either by relabeling the database or creating an unprotected temporary file. By editing private databases at <INDEXTARGET ID="ch215"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch215|private database label --><ITALICS>dbadmin</ITALICS> the system administrator avoids this risk.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The final major reason for logging in at dbadmin is to review the system audit trail. The audit trail is kept at dbadmin to prevent users from determining when they are being audited. To avoid breaching this protection, the system administrator should always review audit data at <ITALICS>dbadmin</ITALICS>. This way any files created while reviewing audit data are protected like the audit trail itself.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Except for the ever-present risk of corrupting system databases, there are few risks specifically presented by using the <ITALICS>dbadmin</ITALICS> MAC label.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Public Database Label (dblow)</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Databases like <INDEXTARGET ID="ch216"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch216|public database label --><FILENAME>/etc/passwd</FILENAME> and most commands are meant to be read or executed by any user, but modified only by the system administrator. To allow global read access while protecting against modification, these databases and commands have the <ITALICS>dblow</ITALICS> MAC label. The system administrator should log in at the<INDEXTARGET ID="ch217"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch217|dblow:label --><ITALICS>&space;dblo</ITALICS>w MAC label when editing these databases. This ensures that users retain access to the databases and that the databases are never assigned a user label.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Unlike with the <ITALICS>dbadmin</ITALICS> label, there are significant risks to sensitive data when the system administrator logs in at <ITALICS>dblow</ITALICS>. If superuser privilege or MAC related capabilities are present at this label, the system administrator may accidentally copy data from <ITALICS>dbadmin</ITALICS> or a user label into a file at <ITALICS>dblow</ITALICS>. Such a file is universally readable.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If possible, the system administrator should avoid MAC related capabilities when logged in at <ITALICS>dblow</ITALICS>. This is not possible in the augmented superuser privilege environment, and it may not always be reasonable in the no-superuser privilege environment. When superuser privilege or MAC related capabilities are present, the system administrator must take special care to avoid declassifying data.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>High Clearance (msenhigh/mintequal)</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>To import unlabeled data into the system and assign it a label, the system administrator logs in at the High Clearance label. This label allows the administrator to read data at any MAC label regardless of integrity. Data stored at this MAC label are unreadable by nonadministrators. The combination of these two factors allows an administrator at this label to read unlabeled data, store it temporarily at High Clearance, examine it to determine its correct MAC label, and then assign that label without fear of accidental disclosure.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch218"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch218|High Clearance label --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>While this is a useful label, the system administrator should always remember that this label confers the authority to ignore the mandatory integrity (MINT) policy of the Trusted IRIX/CMW system. This authority carries the risk of accidentally executing a Trojan Horse program. Also, the administrator should be aware that this label allows private databases to be modified without privilege and, potentially, be created with a label that does not carry MINT protections.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The system administrator is strongly cautioned against functioning at this label. It should be used only for importing unlabeled data.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Auditor</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The auditor monitors system activity looking for suspicious events and reports any suspicions to the system administrator for further analysis and possible corrective action. To perform this function correctly, the auditor requires access to the system audit trail and sufficient privilege to control the audit mechanism. The auditor does not need access to user data.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch219"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch219|definition:of auditor --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The auditor logs in as <ITALICS>auditor</ITALICS> in the IRIX system. This account has the following attributes, listed in the <INDEXTARGET ID="ch220"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch220|auditor:login --><FILENAME>/etc/capability</FILENAME> file:</PARAGRAPH>
<CODE>
Clearance (MAC Label): dbadmin
Capabilities:CAP_AUDIT_WRITE,CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL,CAP_KILL
</CODE>
<PARAGRAPH>The <ITALICS>dbadmin</ITALICS> MAC label, along with DAC permissions on the audit log files, allows the auditor to read the audit trail without privilege. Furthermore, the <ITALICS>dbadmin</ITALICS> label restricts the auditor to reading files at <ITALICS>dbadmin</ITALICS> and <ITALICS>dblow</ITALICS>. User files cannot be accessed because of their mandatory integrity (MINT) labeling. Because the auditor can log in only at this label and has no MAC related capabilities, the auditor is constrained to performing only the auditing function.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Auditing tasks include the following:<INDEXTARGET ID="ch221"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch221|auditor:tasks --></PARAGRAPH>

</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>Determining the basic set of monitored activities can be difficult. The auditor must balance the desire for detailed information against constraints of storage space and the limited human ability to analyze and assimilate the implications of potentially vast amounts of data. Aggressive auditing can produce large amounts of data about benign user activities. Insufficient auditing, however, may cause the auditor to miss crucial details that are the key to discovering or analyzing an attempt to abuse access to the system.</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="22645">Creating Security Policies</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>You must establish an overall security policy for your site, called a Site Security Policy. A security policy is a series of official statements regarding the rules for the use of the system. The purpose of the policy is to create a clear code to ensure the safe use of the system. This policy should be clearly articulated in a written document available to all users. Each person involved with the secure system should know his or her own security guidelines and responsibilities. At some sites, the security policy itself may be classified.<INDEXTARGET ID="ch224"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch224|site security policy  --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch225"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch225|policies:site security --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch226"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch226|definition:of security policy --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>In 1987, the U.S. Computer Security Act mandated that secure computing sites are responsible for the integrity and confidentiality of their resources and information. Computer systems with sensitive information have long been a favorite attack point for malicious and mischievous intruders. Because of the nature of computers, intruders can do much of their work without direct contact with a human being. Damage done to computers and the information they store can come in many forms. Sometimes the damage is severe, when irreplaceable information is lost or corrupted. Sometimes the damage is a case of theft, when a business competitor seeks advance knowledge of product development. Occasionally, users themselves damage the system, either accidentally or with malice.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>A total security policy has a number of segments. Among these are the physical security policy, the procedural security policy, and the system security policy. Take care to ensure that your security policies are concordant and similar in approach to one another. If possible, for consistency, the same person or group should draft all security policies. Avoid complexity in your policies; it can cause users to become confused or to circumvent policy.</PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Physical Security Policy</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>A physical security policy is simply the security measures that protect the computer hardware from damage or unauthorized access. Damage in this sense can come from intruders or from aspects of the location, such as water damage or electrical power fluctuations.

<PARAGRAPH>The most secure software is of no use if your physical hardware is vulnerable. Therefore, when you are planning your system, take note of the location of the hardware. The computer itself should be located behind locked doors, and the number of people with access to the room should be strictly limited. Only users, system administrators, and other responsible people should be allowed in the room at any time. This security should never be relaxed. The power source for the computer should always be protected so that the computer is not subject to power surges or momentary power outages. The location of the computer should have a limited number of windows or be totally enclosed.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Beyond this, any coaxial cable connections to other computers on the secure system should be within the same restricted area. If it is necessary to connect to another computer outside the restricted area, the coaxial cable should be routed in such a manner as to avoid convenient points where the cable may be tapped by an intruder.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Peripheral hardware you attach to your system must likewise be protected from intruders. If you use a storage media device such as a cartridge tape drive, you must store the cartridge tapes after use with as much attention, if not more, to security as any other portion of the system. If a cartridge tape falls into the hands of an intruder, it is a simple matter to extract all the information onto a different system. Printers must also be closely monitored, because once information has been printed, it is available to anyone who can read it. Information import and export devices are the weakest link in your trusted system.</PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>System (PROM) Passwords</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Silicon Graphics workstations and servers support system passwords. These are also often called PROM passwords, because the firmware that supports the passwording is stored in PROM chips on the system's CPU board. It is strongly recommended that all Trusted IRIX/CMW systems make use of PROM passwords.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>These passwords are demanded of the user attempting to access any part of the system while the operating system is not running. For example, with most computers, if you press the hardware reset button, the computer offers you a chance to perform system maintenance before the system reboots. Or in some cases, if you load an installation tape or floppy disk, the system boots from that media instead of booting the usual operating system. Once this has been accomplished, it is a trivial matter for the intruder to mount the disk or disks and gain access to all your files. Because the system password is required before the system does anything but boot the usual operating system, overall security is increased. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The methods for setting the PROM password differ from system to system. To set the system password, see your system's Owner's Guide, or the <DOCTITLE>IRIX Admin: System Configuration and Operation</DOCTITLE> guide. The owner's guide can also instruct you on procedures to follow to remove the password if you forget it.</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>Examine your hardware at this time to determine how much disk space the users and the information are likely to need. Planning adequate disk allocation at the beginning saves having to reinstall later if your system needs to grow. Include provisions for system audit requirements in system planning. The audit trail requires disk space. The specific amount of disk space required depends on the level of auditing configured and the amount of system activity.

</SECTION1>
<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="68488">Planning for Mandatory Sensitivity</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Before you install your system, you must define your classification scheme for Mandatory Sensitivity (MSEN). You must decide how many levels of sensitivity you need for adequate protection of your data. Bear in mind that some classifications are defined for you and cannot be changed. Among these are <INDEXTARGET ID="ch238"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch238|planning:for MSEN --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch239"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch239|MSEN:planning for --><ITALICS>msenlow<INDEXTARGET ID="ch240"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch240|msenlow --></ITALICS>, which always represents the lowest sensitivity level on your system; <ITALICS>msenhigh<INDEXTARGET ID="ch241"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch241|msenhigh --></ITALICS>, which always defines the highest level of sensitivity on your system; and <ITALICS>msenadmin<INDEXTARGET ID="ch242"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch242|msenadmin --></ITALICS>, for MSEN administration files only. The predefined labels and files are discussed in more detail later in this chapter and in <XREF IDREF="73742" TYPE="TITLE">Chapter&nbsp;5, &ldquo;Administering Access Control,&rdquo;</XREF> in this guide. Assigning security classifications and clearances is the responsibility of the system administrator. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Beyond these labels, the system administrator is free to choose and name the clearances and classifications on your system as needed. Remember, however, to use a system that is readily understandable to your users. Familiar terms, such as public, confidential, classified, secret, top secret, and so on are very useful. If your system of classifications is too complex, users may find it difficult to perform their work.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>At this time, you should also choose the categories of information that your system will recognize. This process should be straightforward, because most secure systems deal with only a limited range of information. Also, because a file or resource can be in as many categories as needed, it is easy to make the categories fit the information. Planning the makeup of the files and resources on your system before you begin the installation process is a key step.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Usually, sites converting to Trusted IRIX/CMW move a full complement of existing files to the new system. Each file should be examined to ensure the ongoing security of the system, once the files are installed. You must be certain that no threats to your system are hidden in the bank of files with which you begin.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION1>
<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="34037">Planning for Mandatory Integrity</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Mandatory Integrity (MINT) works in concert with MSEN to ensure that each user accesses only the parts of the system that he or she specifically needs. While MSEN addresses which files and programs a user may see and invoke, MINT assures that the programs and files are free from threats and trusted by the system for that user. When you plan the clearances and classifications for MSEN, the system administrator  should also plan the divisions and grades for MINT. Not all sites find it necessary to use the MINT facilities. MINT can be used to protect your system, but it is not required for a trusted system by the TCSEC (Trusted Computer Systems Evaluation Criteria). <INDEXTARGET ID="ch243"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch243|planning:for MINT --><INDEXTARGET ID="ch244"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: ch244|MINT:planning for --></PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The MINT grades indicate the integrity level of a program or file. Specifically, the MINT grade indicates the quality of the information. Although MINT is a completely separate system from MSEN, the two operate on similar principles. MINT divisions are used to segregate programs by topic, similar to an MSEN category. For example, system administrators can have a MINT division for their utilities and tools, and software developers can have another MINT division for their programs and tools.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Each user has a MINT grade and zero or more divisions in their label. A file or program created by that user automatically inherits that user's MINT grade and divisions (if any). If a user's MINT label has no divisions, then that user's MINT grade must be met by any program that the user accesses. If a user's MINT label contains divisions, a user is constrained to access only programs and files within those divisions. Make certain that each user has appropriate access to files and resources, and plan your MINT system appropriately. Use MINT to keep your sensitive accounts safe from invoking suspect programs that may cause damage.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The primary function of MINT is to make it possible to limit access to programs based on the known quality of the program. MINT protects powerful user accounts, such as root and auditor, from being corrupted or deceived by dummy files of low integrity. A secondary MINT function is its use in tailoring the tool set available to each account so that every user has an appropriate tool set and does not have access to inappropriate tools.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Clearly, the known integrity of a user and the task of the user should be used as guidelines in assigning the integrity level of the user account. Because  a file created by that user inherits the user's integrity level and will thereafter be available to other users of a similar label, it is important to trust each user at the assigned integrity level. MINT makes it possible to disallow high-grade users from viewing files and invoking programs created by less trusted users.</PARAGRAPH>
