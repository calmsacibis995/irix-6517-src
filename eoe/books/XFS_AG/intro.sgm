<INTRODUCTION><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="41688">About This Guide</TITLE><PARAGRAPH><DOCTITLE>Getting Started With XFS Filesystems</DOCTITLE> describes the XFS filesystem and XLV Volume Manager. Developed at Silicon Graphics<SUPERSCRIPT>&reg;</SUPERSCRIPT>, these IRIX<SUPERSCRIPT>&trade;</SUPERSCRIPT> features provide high-performance alternatives to the Extent File System<SUPERSCRIPT>&trade;</SUPERSCRIPT> (EFS) and logical volume managers previously available with IRIX. This guide was prepared in conjunction with the initial release of XFS, called IRIX 5.3 with XFS.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The features described in this guide are included in IRIX system software releases beginning with the IRIX 5.3 with XFS release. However, to use several features, you must obtain NetLS<SUPERSCRIPT>&trade;</SUPERSCRIPT> licenses by purchasing separate software options. The features that require NetLS licenses are:</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>The plexing feature of the XLV Volume Manager, which provides mirroring of disks up to four copies. This feature is provided by the Disk Plexing Option software option. <INDEXTARGET ID="intro1"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: intro1|NetLS licenses:Disk Plexing Option --><INDEXTARGET ID="intro2"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: intro2|plexes:Disk Plexing Option --></PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Guaranteed-rate I/O (GRIO), a feature that enables an application to request a fixed I/O rate and, if granted, be assured of receiving that rate. By default, the system allows four GRIO streams. To obtain up to 40 streams, you must purchase the High Performance Guaranteed-Rate I/O&mdash;5-40 Streams software option. An unlimited number of streams is provided by the High Performance Guaranteed-Rate I/O&mdash;Unlimited Streams software option.<INDEXTARGET ID="intro3"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: intro3|NetLS licenses:High Performance Guaranteed-Rate I/O --></PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>This guide covers only system administration of XFS filesystems and XLV logical volumes (including volumes used for GRIO). See the section <XREF IDREF="67525" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;For More Information&rdquo;</XREF> later in this chapter for information about the programmatic interface to XFS, which is provided with the IRIS<SUPERSCRIPT>&reg;</SUPERSCRIPT> Development Option (IDO) software option.</PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Audience</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>This guide is written for system administrators and other knowledgeable IRIX users who want to use XFS filesystems and/or XLV logical volumes. Because many of the procedures in this guide can result in loss of files on the system if the procedures are not performed correctly, this guide and its procedures should be used only by people who are</PARAGRAPH>

</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH><XREF IDREF="86008" TYPE="TITLE">Chapter&nbsp;2, &ldquo;XFS Filesystem Administration,&rdquo;</XREF> describes filesystem administration tasks such as creating XFS filesystems on new disks and converting filesystems from EFS to XFS.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH><XREF IDREF="45688" TYPE="TITLE">Chapter&nbsp;3, &ldquo;Dumping and Restoring XFS Filesystems,&rdquo;</XREF> explains how to perform filesystem backups with <COMMAND>xfsdump</COMMAND>(1M) and how to restore filesystems and files using <COMMAND>xfsrestore</COMMAND>(1M).</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH><XREF IDREF="92397" TYPE="TITLE">Chapter&nbsp;4, &ldquo;XLV Logical Volumes,&rdquo;</XREF> describes the structure and features of XLV logical volumes and explains how to create and manage logical volumes.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH><XREF IDREF="23852" TYPE="TITLE">Chapter&nbsp;5, &ldquo;Guaranteed-Rate I/O,&rdquo;</XREF>explains how to configure and create real-time XFS filesystems on XLV volumes so that applications can use the guaranteed-rate I/O (GRIO) feature of XFS to ensure high-performance I/O.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
