<ERRORMSG><MSG>mount: <VARIABLE>device</VARIABLE> on <VARIABLE>mountdir</VARIABLE>: Invalid argument
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>This message for a wide variety of problems. For example, this error message occurs if you try to mount a device that doesn't contain a valid filesystem.</PARAGRAPH>
</EXPLANATION>

<ERRORMSG><MSG>WARNING: initial mount of root device 0x2000010 failed with errno 22
PANIC: vfs_mountroot: no root found
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>This panic at system startup is caused by a bad kernel. Some possible causes are:<INDEXTARGET ID="appa3"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: appa3|kernel panics --></PARAGRAPH>

</BULLETIND>
<BULLETIND><PARAGRAPH><ITALICS>eoe2.sw.efs</ITALICS> was not installed, but the root filesystem is an EFS filesystem.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLETIND>
<BULLETIND><PARAGRAPH>Conversion of a system disk with separate root and usr partitions from EFS to XFS was not performed correctly; <FILENAME>/var</FILENAME> wasn't linked to <FILENAME>/usr/var</FILENAME>, so kernel object files weren't found in <FILENAME>/var/sysgen</FILENAME> when the kernel was autoconfigured.</PARAGRAPH>

<ERRORMSG><MSG>XFS dev 0x<VARIABLE>nnnnnnnn</VARIABLE> read error in file system meta-data.

XFS dev 0x<VARIABLE>nnnnnnnn</VARIABLE> write error in file system meta-data.
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>These panics are caused by disk errors in filesystem metadata. 0x<INDEXTARGET ID="appa4"><!-- POSTPROCESSDATA: appa4|metadata, filesystem --><VARIABLE>nnnnnnnn</VARIABLE> is the hexadecimal representation of the device that returned the error. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>After getting this type of panic, you should:</PARAGRAPH>

NOTICE: Ending xFS recovery for filesystem: / (dev: 128/16)

NOTICE: Start mounting filesystem: /vol1
NOTICE: Ending clean xFS mount for filesystem: /vol1
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>These messages, which occur during system startup, are normal and do not indicate that any error or problem has occurred.</PARAGRAPH>
</EXPLANATION>
</ERRORMSG>
<ERRORMSG><MSG><VARIABLE>/mountdir</VARIABLE>: Filesystem too large for device
</MSG>
<EXPLANATION><PARAGRAPH>This message is the result of mounting a disk partition that doesn't have an XFS filesystem on it, but it overlaps or has the same starting point as a disk partition that does have an XFS filesystem on it. For example, you see this error message if you make a filesystem on <FILENAME>/dev/dsk/dks0d2s7</FILENAME>, and then mount <FILENAME>/dev/dsk/dks0d2s0</FILENAME>.</PARAGRAPH>
