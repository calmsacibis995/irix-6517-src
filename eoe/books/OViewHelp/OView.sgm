<TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="AI0010">oview Overview</TITLE>

<PARAGRAPH>
The <ITALICS>oview</ITALICS> displays a dynamic 3D representation of the
topology and activity of an Origin system.  It is a 3D Open Inventor graphical
tool for Performance Co-Pilot (PCP).
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
<ITALICS>oview</ITALICS> can display performance information about CPUs,
nodes and CrayLink routers in Origin systems.  The system topology is
described in the <XREF IDREF="AI0700" TYPE="TITLE">Origin Topology</XREF>
section of this guide.
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
By default, <ITALICS>oview</ITALICS> operates in `live' mode, fetching
the topology and the metrics from the local host in real-time.
<ITALICS>oview</ITALICS> may fetch the metrics from any host which is
running the PCP collector software, or from a PCP archive.
When fetching metrics from an archive, <ITALICS>oview</ITALICS> operates
in `archive' mode where the user can interactively control the current
replay rate and time using a VCR paradigm.
This is particularly useful for retrospective comparisons and for
post-mortem analysis of performance problems where a remote system is
not accessible or a performance analyst is not available on-site.
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
Other PCP tools may be launched from <ITALICS>oview</ITALICS> so that specific
areas of interest from the performance perspective can be explored in more
detail (see the <XREF IDREF="AI0300" TYPE="TITLE">Launch Menu</XREF>).
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
The <ITALICS>oview</ITALICS> window is shown in Figure 1.  It is comprised
of a menu bar, time and scale controls, metric and time values, and an
`examiner' Inventor viewer which displays the 3D scene described in the
<XREF IDREF="AI0700" TYPE="TITLE">Origin Topology</XREF> section.

<PARAGRAPH>
The <ITALICS>scale thumbwheel</ITALICS> and the
<ITALICS>scale text box</ITALICS> (located above the Inventor viewer)
allow the user to apply a multiplier to all values
represented in the scene. Spinning the wheel to the right or increasing
the text value for the scale will increase the length, height or color
of every modulated object in the scene.  Spinning the wheel to the left
or lowering the text value will decrease the length, height or color
of every modulated object.  The button between the thumbwheel and the
text box will reset the scale back to the original state.  In addition,
the metric text for a selected object will indicate the value after
scaling as a percentage of the range.  If the value (above the scale
controls) of a metric after scaling exceeds the defined range for an
object, the object will turn white.

<PARAGRAPH>
Make sure the pointer cursor is active (select the pointer button
on the right-hand edge of the window, or press escape).  Move the
pointer over different objects in the scene.  Metric information and
values for the object currently under the pointer will be displayed
in the <ITALICS>metric information text box</ITALICS>
(located beneath the Menu Bar).
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
Click (with the left mouse button) on an object to select it.
The selected object will have a red wire-frame drawn around it.
When an object has been selected in this way, the metric information
for this object is always displayed in the text box irrespective of
where the mouse pointer is.  (See the selected router in Figure 4).
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
The text box is updated whenever the scene is updated with the latest
value for the metric of current interest.  This description includes
the source, name and instances of the metric, the current value and
units, and the value as a percentage of the expected maximum value.
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
Clicking the left mouse button on another object will change the
selection as only one object may be selected at a time.  Selecting the
background will deselect any selected objects.

<SECTION2 HELPID = "topology">
<TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="AI0700">Origin Topology</TITLE>
<PARAGRAPH>
<ITALICS>oview</ITALICS> accurately represents the topology of an
Origin system by modulating objects which represent the routers,
nodes, CPUs and CrayLinks.  This is illustrated in Figure 5.  Note
that the colors may vary with differing application resources.

</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
The CrayLink tubes between routers and nodes show the
<ITALICS>receive</ITALICS> utilization of the associated node or
router port using colored bands which grow toward the mid-point of the
link as the utilization increases.  <ITALICS>Receive by-pass</ITALICS>
and <ITALICS>receive queued</ITALICS> utilization of the link are
shown as stacked bands in violet and yellow respectively.  The routers
change color according to the <ITALICS>average</ITALICS> receive
utilization of all connected links on the router.
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
Nodes are represented by short cylinders.  CPUs use a stack of three
colored blocks to show the <ITALICS>user, system</ITALICS> and
<ITALICS>wait</ITALICS> utilization of each CPU.  The grey part of a
CPU, if visible, represents unused CPU capacity.
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
If a metric exceeds the expected maximum value, the modulated object
will change color to white.  If a metric is unavailable, the object
will change to a dark grey.
</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>
To avoid cluttering the scene in larger configurations, the initial
scene will show routers but may not show the nodes and/or CPUs,
depending on the number of routers present in the system hardware
inventory.  Small systems (of up to four routers) will start with
nodes and CPUs displayed.  Systems of five to eight routers will have
the CPUs initially hidden, but show the nodes.  A system with more
than eight CrayLink routers will begin showing neither nodes nor CPUs.
CPUs cannot be shown without their associated nodes.  Nodes and CPUs
may be interactively displayed and removed from the scene using the
<XREF IDREF="AI0200" TYPE="TITLE">Options Menu</XREF>.
