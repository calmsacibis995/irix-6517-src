<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>ICRASH</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>ICRASH is a system crash analysis tool that can greatly enhance your ability to analyze IRIX system core dumps. It contains many features that enable it to display information in a clear, easy-to-read manner about the events that precede a system crash. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The <SCREENDISPLAY>availmon</SCREENDISPLAY> component of Embedded Support Partner uses data from ICRASH to determine the cause of any system interruptions that <SCREENDISPLAY>availmon</SCREENDISPLAY> detects. The <SCREENDISPLAY>availmon</SCREENDISPLAY> reports also include ICRASH data.</PARAGRAPH>
