<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Monitoring Software</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>A key function of Embedded Support Partner is monitoring the system. The Embedded Support Partner base package includes software that enables the following types of monitoring on a system:</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Configuration monitoring (with the <SCREENDISPLAY>configmon</SCREENDISPLAY> tool)</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>

<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Availability monitoring (with the <SCREENDISPLAY>availmon</SCREENDISPLAY> tool)</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>Monitoring is performed by tools that run as standalone programs and communicate with the Embedded Support Partner control software.</PARAGRAPH>
<NOTE><PREFIX>Note</PREFIX>Performance monitoring is available through the <SCREENDISPLAY>pmie</SCREENDISPLAY> application, which is included in the Performance Co-Pilot Execution Only Environment (<SCREENDISPLAY>pcp_eoe</SCREENDISPLAY> subsystem). Refer to <XREF IDREF="10366" TYPE="TITLE">&ldquo;Performance Monitoring Tools,&rdquo;</XREF> for more information.</NOTE>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Configuration Monitoring</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The base package includes a configuration monitoring application, <SCREENDISPLAY>configmon</SCREENDISPLAY>. The <SCREENDISPLAY>configmon</SCREENDISPLAY> application monitors the system configuration by performing the following functions when configuration events occur:</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>It determines the current software and hardware configuration of a system, gathering as much detail as possible (for example, serial numbers, board revision levels, installed software products, installed patches, installation dates, etc.). </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>It verifies that the configuration data in the SSDB is up-to-date by comparing the current system configuration data with the configuration data in the SSDB.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>It updates the SSDB so that it is current (with information about the hardware or software that has changed).</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>It provides data for various system configuration reports that the system administrator or field support personnel can use.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>The <SCREENDISPLAY>configmon</SCREENDISPLAY> application runs at system start-up time to gather updated configuration information.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Event Monitoring</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Embedded Support Partner is an event-driven system. Events can come from various sources. Examples of events are: </PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Configuration events</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Inferred performance events</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Availability events</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>System critical events (from the kernel and various device drivers) </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Diagnostic events</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>The Embedded Support Partner base package includes an event monitoring subsystem to monitor important system events that are logged into <SCREENDISPLAY>syslogd</SCREENDISPLAY> by the kernel, drivers, and other system components. This subsystem is part of the <SCREENDISPLAY>eventmond</SCREENDISPLAY> daemon, which starts at boot time immediately after the <SCREENDISPLAY>syslogd</SCREENDISPLAY> daemon starts. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>All events pass to the event monitoring subsystem by using one of the following methods:</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>They use the <SCREENDISPLAY>eventmon</SCREENDISPLAY> API.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>They pass through <SCREENDISPLAY>esplogger</SCREENDISPLAY>.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>They come directly from <SCREENDISPLAY>syslogd</SCREENDISPLAY>.</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>The <SCREENDISPLAY>eventmond</SCREENDISPLAY> daemon monitors events from <SCREENDISPLAY>syslogd</SCREENDISPLAY>, and the <SCREENDISPLAY>eventmon</SCREENDISPLAY> API and uses the SEM to log the events in the SSDB. <SCREENDISPLAY>syslogd</SCREENDISPLAY> performs some event throttling/filtering. You can configure Embedded Support Partner to do more extensive event throttling/filtering, which reduces system resource overhead when <SCREENDISPLAY>syslogd</SCREENDISPLAY> logs a large number of duplicate events because of an error condition.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>If the SSDB server is not running when <SCREENDISPLAY>eventmond</SCREENDISPLAY> attempts to log events, <SCREENDISPLAY>eventmond</SCREENDISPLAY> buffers the events until it can successfully log the events.</PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION3 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>eventmon API</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The <SCREENDISPLAY>eventmon</SCREENDISPLAY> API provides the mechanism that enables tasks to communicate with <SCREENDISPLAY>eventmond</SCREENDISPLAY>. The <SCREENDISPLAY>eventmond</SCREENDISPLAY> daemon receives information from external monitoring tasks through API function calls that the tasks send or that <SCREENDISPLAY>esplogger</SCREENDISPLAY> sends to <SCREENDISPLAY>eventmond</SCREENDISPLAY>. Each command that is sent to <SCREENDISPLAY>eventmond</SCREENDISPLAY> returns a status code that indicates successful completion or the reason that a failure occurred. </PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION3>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Availability Monitoring </TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The base package also includes an availability monitoring application, <SCREENDISPLAY>availmon</SCREENDISPLAY>. The <SCREENDISPLAY>availmon</SCREENDISPLAY> application monitors machine uptime and differentiates between controlled shutdowns, system panics, power cycles, and power failures. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Availability monitoring is useful for high-availability systems, production systems, or other customer sites where monitoring availability information is important.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The <SCREENDISPLAY>availmon</SCREENDISPLAY> application runs at startup time to gather the availability data.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION2>
</SECTION1>
<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Notification Software</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Notification is one of the actions that can be programmed to take place when a particular system event occurs. The notification software provides several types of notifiers, including dialog boxes on the local system, e-mail, paging, and diagnostic reports and other types of reports. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The <SCREENDISPLAY>espnotify</SCREENDISPLAY> tool provides the following notification capabilities for Embedded Support Partner:</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>E-mail notifications </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>GUI-based or console text notifications (with audio if the notification is on the local host)</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Program execution for notification</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Alphanumeric and chatty paging through the <SCREENDISPLAY>Qpage</SCREENDISPLAY> application</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>Typically, the Decision Support Module (DSM) invokes the <SCREENDISPLAY>espnotify</SCREENDISPLAY> tool in response to some event. However, you can run the <SCREENDISPLAY>espnotify</SCREENDISPLAY> tool as a standalone application, if necessary.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION1>
<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Console Software</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The Embedded Support Partner base package includes console software that enables you to interact with it from a Web browser. The console software uses the Configurable Web Server (<SCREENDISPLAY>esphttpd</SCREENDISPLAY>) to receive input from the user, send it to the Embedded Support Partner software running on the system, and return the results to the user. (<SCREENDISPLAY>inetd</SCREENDISPLAY> invokes <SCREENDISPLAY>esphttpd</SCREENDISPLAY> whenever a Web server connection is needed.)</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The console software also includes a report generator core and a set of plugins to create various types of reports. These reports are based on the data that the Embedded Support Partner tasks provide, such as <SCREENDISPLAY>configmon</SCREENDISPLAY>, <SCREENDISPLAY>availmon</SCREENDISPLAY>, etc.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>In the base package, you can access the following types of reports:</PARAGRAPH>
