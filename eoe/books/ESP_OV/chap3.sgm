<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Multiple System Monitoring</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The extended package adds the capabilities to monitor multiple systems at a site by including a System Group Manager (SGM). The system selected as the group manager runs the SGM, which manages the group and acts as the SEM for the system that is the group manager.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The SGM provides functionality to uniformly manage multiple systems when more than one system is installed at a site. Specifically, it performs the following functions:</PARAGRAPH>

<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Notification (based on the events that occur on systems in the group)</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>Any system within a system group can be designated the group manager (it is possible to have more than one group manager). A system that is designated as the group manager monitors all systems in the group as well as itself. </PARAGRAPH>
