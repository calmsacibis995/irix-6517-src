<CHAPTER LBL="1"><TITLE><XREFTARGET ID="14150">About Embedded Support Partner</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>SGI's products range from desktop workstations to supercomputers, which makes its product line one of the broadest in the industry. Supporting such a diverse product line creates many challenges. Embedded Support Partner was created to address some of these challenges by automatically detecting system conditions that indicate potential future problems and notifying the appropriate personnel. This enables SGI customers and support personnel to proactively support systems and resolve issues before they develop into actual failures.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Embedded Support Partner integrates monitoring, notifying, and reporting functions. It enables users to monitor one or more systems at a site from a local or remote connection. It includes the following capabilities:</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>This document describes the version of Embedded Support Partner that is included in the IRIX&nbsp;6.5.6 operating system release.</PARAGRAPH>
<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Distribution</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The Embedded Support Partner software is distributed in two levels:</PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>A base package</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>An extended package</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Base Package</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The base package includes the functionality necessary to: </PARAGRAPH>
<BULLETLIST><BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Configure Embedded Support Partner</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Monitor a single system for system and performance events, configuration changes, and availability </PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Notify support personnel when specific events occur</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
<BULLET><PARAGRAPH>Generate basic reports</PARAGRAPH>
</BULLET>
</BULLETLIST>
<PARAGRAPH>The features in the base package are included in the IRIX 6.5.5 and later releases at no&nbsp;extra&nbsp;cost. They are installed by default, and Embedded Support Partner begins monitoring the system as soon as the system is booted. You can configure the base package to specify what types of events it should monitor and whom it should notify when events occur.</PARAGRAPH>
<NOTE><PREFIX>Note</PREFIX>Embedded Support Partner can also monitor events from diagnostic tests and perform actions based on these events. To use these optional features, install the diagnostics from the <DOCTITLE>Internal Support Tools 2.0</DOCTITLE> CD, which is available only to SGI personnel.</NOTE>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = ""><TITLE>Extended Package</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>The extended package adds features that work with the base package, including capabilities that enable it to monitor events on multiple systems at a site and provide enhanced reports.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The features in the extended package are also included in the IRIX 6.5.5 and later releases, but these features are not enabled unless the customer acquires a license to use them. (A 90-day free trial license is included; full licenses are included in some service contracts or may be purchased separately.)</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH>Remote support is implemented as a client/server application. This implementation enables you to connect to the console software from a remote location, which lets you control Embedded Support Partner from the remote location. This capability provides SGI support personnel with a &ldquo;virtual seat&rdquo; on the system or systems on which they need to work. </PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Remote support offers significant benefits for the field, the Customer Support Center (CSC), and Global Product Support (GPS). It enables service providers to perform an online diagnosis remotely so that they can arrive on-site with an accurate solution. </PARAGRAPH>
