<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = "overview"><TITLE>Overview</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>IRIX Checkpoint and Restart (CPR) is a facility for saving a running process or set of processes and, at some later time, restarting the saved process(es) from the point already reached. A checkpoint image is saved in a directory, and restarted by reading saved state from this directory to resume execution.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>The <COMMAND>cview</COMMAND> window provides a graphical user interface for checkpointing, restarting checkpoints, querying checkpoint status, and deleting statefiles. Two tabs at the bottom of the <COMMAND>cview</COMMAND> window select either the checkpoint or restart control panel.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION1>
<SECTION1 LBL="" HELPID = "howToChkpt"><TITLE>How to Checkpoint</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Under the STEP I button, select a process or set of processes from the list. To checkpoint a process group, a session group, an IRIX array session, a process hierarchy, or an <BOLD>sproc</BOLD> shared group, select a category from the Individual Process drop-down menu. In the filename field below, enter the name of a directory for storing the statefile.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Click the STEP II button if you want to change checkpoint options, such as whether to exit or continue the process, or control open file and mapped file dispositions.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Click the STEP III OK button to initiate the checkpoint, or the Cancel Checkpoint button to discontinue.</PARAGRAPH>

If a statefile is located somewhere besides your home directory, change directories using the icon finder at the top.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Select any options you want, such as whether to retain the original process ID, whether to restore the original working directory, or whether to restore the original root directory.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH>Click the OK Go Restart button to initiate restart.</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = "statefile"><TITLE>Statefile Field</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>A statefile is a directory containing information about a process or set of processes, including the names of open files and system objects. Statefiles contain all available information about a running process, to enable restart. Statefiles are stored as files inside a directory, protected by normal IRIX security mechanisms.</PARAGRAPH>

<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = "sysUpgr"><TITLE>System Upgrade</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>Click here if you intend to upgrade operating system software before restarting this set of processes. When you checkpoint for system upgrade, CPR saves not only open file and process states, but also any system commands and libraries that are necessary to restart the statefile accurately.</PARAGRAPH>
</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = "step2"><TITLE>Step II Button</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>This section of the checkpoint control panel sets checkpoint attributes, similar to the attributes controlled by the <COMMAND>cpr</COMMAND> command's <FILENAME>$HOME/.cpr</FILENAME> file.

</SECTION2>
<SECTION2 LBL="" HELPID = "fileAttr"><TITLE>File Dispositions</TITLE><PARAGRAPH>This drop-down menu controls how CPR treats files that the selected process has open at checkpoint time. The five choices are as follows:</PARAGRAPH>
<HANGLIST><HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>MERGE</HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>No explicit file save at checkpoint. Upon restart, reopen the file and seek to the previous offset. This may be used for files that are not modified after checkpoint, or for files where it is acceptable to overwrite changes made between checkpoint and restart time, particularly past the saved offset point. If programs seek before writing, changes preceding the offset point could be overwritten as well.</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>IGNORE </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>No explicit file save at checkpoint. Upon restart, reopen the file as it was originally opened, at offset zero (even if originally opened for append). If the file was originally opened for writing, as with the <FUNCTION>fopen()</FUNCTION> &ldquo;w&rdquo; or &ldquo;a&rdquo; flag, this action has the effect of overwriting the entire file.</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>APPEND </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>No explicit file save at checkpoint. Upon restart, append to the end of the file. This disposition is good for log files.</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>REPLACE </HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>Explicitly save the file at checkpoint. Upon restart, replace the original file with the saved one. Any changes made to the original file between checkpoint and restart time are overwritten by the saved file.</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
<HANGPAIR><HANGITEM>SUBSTITUTE</HANGITEM>
<HANGBODY><PARAGRAPH>Explicitly save the file at checkpoint. Upon restart, reopen the saved file as an anonymous substitution for the original file. This is similar to the REPLACE mode except that the original file remains untouched, unless specifically altered by the program.</PARAGRAPH>
</HANGBODY>
</HANGPAIR>
