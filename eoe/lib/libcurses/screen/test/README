This test (in main.c) haphazardly calls most of the functions in libcurses.

This test is useful if you have an old version of libcurses, and are trying
to bring up a new one.

The intended strategy of this test is to compare the output from the old
version of libcurses with that of a new version.
For example, if you linked main.c with an old version of libcurses into
the executable test.old, and then linked main.c with a new version of
libcurses into the executable test.new, you would do the following:

% test.old < input_file > out.old
% test.new < input_file > out.new
% diff out.old out.new

There should be no difference if the new libcurses is working correctly.
If there is a difference, it is easier to do a hex dump of the file
before the diff so that the terminal does not get the escape sequences
from the diff.  You can make your own input_file haphazardly (or
carefully).

Note that libcurses figures out your terminal type by the environmental
variable TERM, so you can check the output of something like vt100 on
an iris-ansi-net terminal by changing TERM to vt100 (just be careful
that you change TERM back to iris-ansi-net on the same command line;
otherwise, your shell will mess up).
