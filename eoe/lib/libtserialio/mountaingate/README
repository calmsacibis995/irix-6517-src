Modified tserialio.o, sample deck control driver, and sample user-mode app
which uses both.

See the file "mgate*" in this package for the terms and details of the
SGI/Mountaingate agreement, as well as the version number of this
package.

To use this,

1. save your old /var/sysgen/boot/tserialio.o somewhere

2. copy the tserialio.o in this package to /var/sysgen/boot and
reboot, so that your kernel is rebuilt.  you can even do 
   unsetenv ROOT
   unsetenv TOOLROOT
   autoconfig -fv
   init 6
if you want to see the rebuild happen yourself.

3. do 'make' to bulid the driver, driver.c->driver.pre.o->driver.o,
and to build the user-mode test program user.c->user.  I stole the
command line arguments for driver.c from an internal SGI Makefile.  I
recommend that you instead follow whatever guidelines our kernel
developer documentation gives you for the cc and ld flags for a
loadable driver.

4. as root, do 'make nodes' to create two device nodes.  I have chosen
a major number 271 at random because it was unused (see
/usr/include/sys/major.h).  This should do for you for your O2 demo.
the Makefile puts the nodes in the current directory for convenience.

5. as root, do 'make load' to load the driver.

6. run 'user'.  you should see foo increment about 1000 times per
second, and you should see 'bar' go up to 3 and stay there.  any
characters that arrive at serial port 2 should be echoed out within
2ms.

7. modify the driver as desired, doing 'make unload' and then
'make load' to re-load it when you modify it.
