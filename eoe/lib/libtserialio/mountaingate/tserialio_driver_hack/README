here is the source code to the tserialio driver we gave mountaingate.

-r--r--r--    1 cpirazzi engr       72748 Dec 18 16:00 tserialio.c.bonsai.1.4
-rw-r--r--    1 cpirazzi engr       75617 Dec 18 16:01 tserialio.c.bonsai.MOUNTAINGATE.and.460909

to see the small differences, do a gdiff between these files.

note that this change also fixes bug 460909, since that affected
mountaingate.

we did not give Mountainge the source, only the compiled .o file.

don't send the tserialio.c file to mountaingate.
