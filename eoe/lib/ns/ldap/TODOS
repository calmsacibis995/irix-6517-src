1.- I have noticed that it may be useful to specify the base of a
search not only based on the server but also based on the map we 
are trying to access. So it should be possible to store different
NIS maps in different databases on the same server. I just noticed 
this after realizing that some databases backens create such a huge
files that even a few entries in a NIS database will require many
Megs of disk. 

2.- For the protocols file one call to getprotoent() results in two
calls to ns_list( protocols )!. It appears that LDAP round trip time
is too large and the nfs request that results in the list operation
is replicated. Support must be added at the daemon side to filter
replicated requests and avoid overhead caused by this.

3.- The nis netgroup map file is not supported yet. Additional 
support must be added to the parser of the configuration file
and the response parser so this map can be supported.


4.- Add support for referrals.
