**NOTE**

The sources contained within this directory are used to build both the
libnsl and libxnet libraries.

There are sources which are not referenced by the libnsl/src/nsl/Makefile,
but are used within the libxnet/src/nsl/Makefile.  For example, the two
source modules: t_getprotaddr.c and t_strerror.c are not part of the libnsl
library, but are included as part of the libxnet library.  Please do not
remove any files you think are not used without first checking the Makefiles
within the libxnet tree.  By using this scheme we need to only have the
sources exist within one directory and control the inclusion or exclusion
with #ifdefs.
