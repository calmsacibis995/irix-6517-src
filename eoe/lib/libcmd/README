systbl.c is commented out for now. When we figure out what to do with
our system call numbering scheme then go back and fix this.

tp_ops.c is commented out for now, when we support the tp  driver in
the kernel then go back and fix this.

None of this stuff has been tested. The idea is to get the library in first
then start testing it by building and running SVR4 commands.
