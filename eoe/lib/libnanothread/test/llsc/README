There is a problem with leaving the load linked bit in the processor set
correctly when context switch in resume_nid.  This will make ll/sc loops
in user code produce incorrect results.  The test in this directory tests
whether the mechanisms that are used in resume_nid to reset the load linked
bit works.  The test should run "forever" if load linked bit can be reset.
Otherwise, the test exits quickly.

To date the known processors that will work with resume_nid are:
R10000 R2.5
R10000 R2.6

To date the known processors that should not work with resume_nid are:
R4400 R5.0
R4400 R6.0
