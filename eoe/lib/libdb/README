IMPORTANT NOTE:

This is Berkeley-DB. A plug in replacement to dbm/ndbm with
many improvements and enhancements.

DB is freeware (berkeley copyright) that is maintained _outside_
SGI. All I do here is build it on SGI, test it, and patch as
necessary to make sure it works.

In order to avoid the repetitive and hopeless work of:

	1) Re-applying SGI specific patches to the berkeley
	   source distribution

	2) Re-reorganizing the libdb source tree to match SGI
	   source tree (separate lib/man/header hierarchies)

	3) Re-writing the libdb Makefiles to fit SGI Makefile
	   conventions

Whenever this software is updated/enhanced by its maintainers,

I prefer to:

	1) Stray from the IRIX source tree structure and Makefile
	   conventions and leave the DB distribution tree as intact
	   as possible.

	2) mail all local SGI patches are back to the maintainers
	   so they can be merged into the original distribution.

	3) Do all the SGI specific build stuff in the parent
	   directory libdb and its Makefile. It does all:
	   libs, headers, and man pages.

The package includes 5 man pages, a header file, and a library
(libdb.so) that is built o32, n32, and 64. See the Makefile
in this directory for details.

The IRIX port directory is automatically created as "PORT/irix"
which is a tlink'ed duplicate tree of the originally distributed
directory PORT/irix.5.2 (renaming was done to avoid confusion
and to avoid the endless revision names syndrome)
