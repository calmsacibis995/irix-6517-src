<H4>1.7 What parts of the source tree contain the results of this project?</H4>
Currently:
<UL>
<LI>/proj/array_3.0/isms/array/arraysvcs

<UL>
<LI>none
</UL>

<H3>2. Goals:</H3>

<H4>2.1 What problem (or problems) is this project solving and for whom?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>The <B>arraysvcs</B> product already ships to customers as part of the
Array 1.0 and 2.0 software packages, which is typically given to sites that
have purchased [Power]Challenge arrays.
However, There are several third party and internal software products
that either currently or will eventually make use of array services on
systems that are not necessarily formal "arrays".
Although the Array software package is available to any server
customer free for the asking, this is inconvenient and confusing for
customers and annoying to ISVs.  Therefore, we would like to make
array services available as part of the base IRIX software release.

<P>
It is worth pointing out that although the Array software package is
generally only given to high-end server customers, the array services
software itself is useful on <I>any</I> system in the product line
that runs IRIX 6.2 or better, and in fact a couple of ISVs have
expressed interest specifically in using array services on low-end systems.
The software is currently tested and running on low-end platforms.

<P>
Note that until there is another all-platforms release of IRIX, it would
still be necessary to include the array services software as part of
the Array package as well.
Until that time, our intention is that the array services software that 
ships as part of IRIX would always be identical to the array services
software that has <I>already</I> been shipped as part of the most recent Array
package.
</UL>

<H4>2.2 What specific features or functions are being created?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Array services consists of a library, a daemon, and several user commands
that allow groups of related processes to be managed as a single unit, even
if those processes reside on different physical machines.
See 5.1 for more details.
<P>
The array services software is fairly self-contained, and should not affect
any other parts of IRIX.
</UL>

<H4>2.3 What user documentation will be produced?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Lots of
<A HREF="http://uniscan.engr.sgi.com/~rdb/Array/ManPages.html">man pages</A>
and the usual relnotes.
</UL>

<H4>2.4 What are the quantitative performance and resource usage goals for the product?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>There are no particular quantitative performance goals; qualitatively,
the user commands should not be "painfully slow".
<P>
<LI>In terms of memory usage, the array services daemon should
not take significantly more system resources than most
other system daemons (e.g. inetd), particularly if the machine is
not a member of a formal "array".
Currently, these goals are being met.
On a 32-bit 6.2 Indy system with a very basic array configuration, "ps"
shows:
<PRE>
  F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI NI  P    SZ:RSS      WCHAN TTY     TIME CMD
 b0 S     0   475     1  0  60 20  *   394:4     8833631c ?       0:00 arrayd 
 b0 S     0   227     1  0  60 20  *   344:18    883362bc ?       0:02 inetd 
</PRE>
<P>
On a 64-bit system that is part of a full-blown array configuration:
<PRE>
  F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI NI  P    SZ:RSS      WCHAN TTY     TIME CMD
 30 S     0   685     1  0  60 20  *   104:52     1055570 ?       0:03 arrayd 
 30 S     0   269     1  0  60 20  *    88:20     1054870 ?       0:21 inetd 
</PRE>
<P>
Note that for many low end systems, it may not be necessary to run an array
services daemon at all, in which case memory usage is 0.
<P>
<LI>The disk usage for a "fully loaded" installation of array services should
not exceed a few megabytes, and in fact it currently only takes about 1.75MB.
A "minimal" installation of just O32/N32 DSO's takes about 250K.
<P>
<LI>In general, array services should have no discernible impact on overall
system performance, and this in fact seems to be the case on existing
installations.
</UL>

<H4>2.5 What tests are planned to measure performance?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Empirical observation.
</UL>

<H4>2.6 What other functionality will regress in performance due to these changes?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>none
</UL>

<H4>2.7 What are this project's goals for reliability, testability, robustness, maintainability?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>"The usual".
</UL>

<H4>2.8 What tests are planned to assure functionality and reliability.</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Same as the Array software package.
Note that because the version of array services that ships
with ficus will be one that has already shipped as part of the latest Array
software package release, it will have already gone through some amount of
testing in customer hands.
</UL>

<H4>2.9 What problems are NOT going to be addressed by this project that someone might expect to be addressed?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>I can't think of any.
</UL>

<H4>2.10 What is the target market user expertise?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Sysadmin expertise or better. This is not intended for use by
naive end-users (nor is it likely to be of any interest to them).
</UL>

<H3>3. Dependencies:</H3>

<H4>3.1 What will be required of the customer to use this product (investment, training, reconfiguration, etc.)?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Customers that would actually like to take advantage of array services
will need to set up a
configuration file and use <I>chkconfig</I> to turn array services on.
For simple configurations, a tool is provided to do all of this with a
single command.
<LI>If array services is being installed simply to satisfy a prereq
from some other software product, no training/configuration/etc. is required
at all.
(Note that this would not necessarily be a pointless prereq - there are parts
of array services that are still useful even if it is unconfigured.)
</UL>

<H4>3.2 Which projects depend on the results of this project?</H4>
<UL>
<LI><B>PerfAcct II</B>, an accounting software package by Instrumental Inc.
<LI><B>LSF</B>, a batch processing facility by Genias.
<LI><B>NQE</B>, another batch processing facility by CraySoft.
<LI><B>CPR</B>, a checkpoint/restart facility being developed here at SGI
for Ficus.
<P>
Note that except for CPR, these projects are all third-party products.
</UL>

<H4>3.3 Which projects does this project depend upon?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>none
</UL>

<H4>3.4 Which platforms will be supported and which will not?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Array services will run on any platform that has IRIX 6.2 or better
installed.
</UL>
