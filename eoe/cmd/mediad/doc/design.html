<H1>Moose Mediad Design Document</H1>
<H2>Goals</H2>
<H3>No Objectserver</H3>
<P>The moose release will not have objectserver to kick around any more. mediad/banyan
is tightly coupled to the objectserver, so new mediad needs new functions
and interfaces to provide the functionality that objectserver previously
provided.</P>
<H3>Non-SCSI devices</H3>
<P>The moose's floppy is on a parallel port, not SCSI. Mediad/banyan is 100%
SCSI oriented. Moose mediad must also support non-SCSI devices such as the
floppy.</P>
<H3>Icons Stay Alive</H3>
<P>Mediad/banyan stops monitoring devices when an application such as cdplayer
or SoftWindows takes exclusive use of a device, and is unable to update
the desktop's icon states. Moose mediad should continue to sniff device
state and update its clients even when those apps are running.</P>
<H3>Easily Extensible</H3>
<P>Mediad/banyan supports 3 types of filesystem on 7 types of device. It has
3 * 7 = 21 places where it recognizes a particular filesystem on a particular
device. That's getting unwieldy to maintain. We expect more devices and
more filesystems in the future, so new mediad should not require M *N places
where filesytems are recognized. Instead, we should have an M + N design.</P>
<P>Also, moose mediad should let us release support for a new device, e.g.
in a patch, without re-releasing all devices. That should prevent, or at
least reduce, rev locking between devices.</P>
<H3>Better Device Alias Support</H3>
<P>Under Irix, a particular device can be referred to by several different
names. E.g., <SAMP>/dev/scsi/sc0d4l0</SAMP>, <SAMP>/dev/rdsk/dks0d4vol</SAMP>, and <SAMP>/dev/dsk/dks0d4s7</SAMP> all refer to the same disk. Mediad recognizes device name aliases in an
ad hoc way, and this is a continuing maintenance problem.</P>
<H3>Support Hybrid/Partitioned Media</H3>
<P>Mediad/banyan assumes that every disk has exactly one file system on it.
That's not true in the case of partitioned disks nor hybrid CD-ROMs. Moose
mediad should be able to mount any/all partitions, and should let the user
control which one(s) are mounted.</P>
<P>In the first release, it will not be possible to mount more than one partition
at a time.</P>
<H3>Performance</H3>
<P>Moose mediad should use no more system resources (memory, CPU, I/O bandwidth)
than mediad/banyan. Mediad/banyan's CPU and I/O consumption are negligible,
so the only real concern is resident size.</P>
<H2>Design Overview</H2>
<P>Moose mediad's basic design metaphor is a device, filesystem, and client
interface independent core with many ancillary modules. The core implements
mediad's basic logic and has interfaces to all the ancillary modules. The
ancillary modules are either in the form of DSOs, where we want to be able
to field-extend various modules, or linked into the mediad executable, where
we don't want field-extensibility.</P>
<H3>Device/Partition Addressing</H3>
<P>Rather than referring to devices by name (<SAMP>/dev/<I>whatever</I></SAMP>) or by SCSI controller/ID/LUN, moose mediad defines a <B>DeviceAddress</B> as an abstract type, whose concrete subtypes are <B>SCSIAddress</B> and <B>ParallelAddress</B>. More subtypes can be defined as needed. The SCSIAddress is, sure enough,
composed of <B><I>&lt;controller, ID, LUN&gt;</I></B>. Since moose has a single parallel port, a ParallelAddress is unique. DeviceAddresses
may be compared for equality, using <CODE>operator ==</CODE>. There are routines to convert a H/W inventory record or a SCSI triple to a DeviceAddress.</P>
<P>A <B>PartitionAddress</B> on a device is defined as the tuple <B><I>&lt;DeviceAddress, format, number&gt;</I></B>, where <B><I>DeviceAddress</I></B> is as defined above, <B><I>format</I></B> is an enum of the known filesystem formats, and <B><I>number</I></B> is the partition number of that particular format. Partition numbers are
defined per-format. E.g., DOS uses 1-4 for primary partitions and 5-8 for
extended partitions. The constant <CODE>PartitionAddress::WholeDisk</CODE> can be used as a partition number. Note that a PartitionAddress does not
specify sector numbers. In some cases, an address exists when there is no specific device to attach it to,
and no specific sector numbers. Weird, but necessary.</P>
<P>Both DeviceAddress and PartitionAddress are values. By that I mean that
instances can be created and destroyed without side effects.</P>
<H3><A NAME="DSOs">Device DSOs</A></H3>
<P>Each supported device has a separate DSO containing the code that knows
how to talk to that specific device and also describing that device's features.
Each DSO has a routine named &quot;instantiate&quot; which looks at a <B>DeviceInfo</B> record and decides whether that DSO knows that device. If so, the instantiate
routine returns a pointer to new <B>Device</B> object. Otherwise, it returns nil.</P>
<P>Device objects are derived from class <B>Device</B>. Look at <KBD>Device.H</KBD> to see the exact interface of a device.</P>
<H3>Format DSOs</H3>
<P>Each supported filesystem format has a separate DSO containing the code
that can recognize that format. Each format DSO has an &quot;inspect&quot; routine
that is called to inspect a device for filesystems of that format. When
the inspect routine finds one or more filesystems, it instantiates Partitions
by calling <CODE>Partition::create()</CODE>, then instantiates Volumes by calling <CODE>SimpleVolume::create()</CODE>.</P>
<H3>Mediad Core</H3>
<P>The mediad core scans the hardware inventory and attempts to instantiate
a Device subclass on each record in the inventory. When it finds a supported
device, it creates a <B>DeviceMonitor</B> to watch that device. The DeviceMonitor accesses the hardware through the
Device subclass. The DeviceMonitor also generates events on insertion, ejection,
mount, and dismount, and responds to commands to eject, lock or unlock devices.</P>
<H3>Client Interfaces</H3>
<P>There are three client interfaces. They are the <B>CompatClient</B>, the <B>MonitorClient</B>, and <B>FsdClient</B> interfaces. CompatClient is the same interface as mediad/banyan supported.
MonitorClient is a new interface which describes the state of all removable
devices and volumes in the system, and generates events when that state
changes. FsdClient monitors changes to /etc/fsd.auto through the miracle
of fam, and changes mediad's behavior when that file changes.</P>
<H3>Invocation and Command Line Arguments</H3>
<P>Mediad supports most of the command line arguments implemented by mediad/banyan.
It also is hard-linked to the /usr/sbin/eject command, and it can also be
invoked by inetd, in the case where a remote MonitorClient wants to see
the system state, but mediad isn't already running.</P>
<H3>Mediad Objects</H3>
<P>Since mediad is object oriented, it makes sense to describe its design in
terms of its objects. Each class is described in detail in its header file.</P>
<H3>Support Classes</H3>
<P>These classes provide nifty support functions for the rest of mediad.</P>
<H4>Enumerable</H4>
<P>Several classes are subclasses of <B>Enumerable</B>. By subclassing Enumerable, a class gets a variety of methods for enumerating
its instances. To access all elements sequentially, use <CODE>first()</CODE>, <CODE>next()</CODE>, <CODE>prev()</CODE> and <CODE>last()</CODE>. To access elements nonsequentially, use <CODE>index()</CODE>, <CODE>nth()</CODE> and <CODE>count()</CODE>.</P>
<H4>Scheduler and friends</H4>
<P>The <B>Scheduler</B> is based on <CITE>select(2)</CITE>. A module can create a <B>Task</B> to be executed at some time or at regular intervals, or it can create an <B>IOHandler</B>, which will be called when a descriptor becomes ready for I/O. IOHandler
is abstract - the three concrete subclasses are <B>ReadHandler</B>, <B>WriteHandler</B>, and <B>ExceptHandler</B>.</P>
<H4>FAMonitor and subclasses</H4>
<P><B>FAMonitor</B> is an abstract class of &quot;filesystem entity monitored by FAM&quot;. The two subclasses
are <B>FileMonitor</B> and <B>DirectoryMonitor</B>. When the file or directory is changed, the FAMonitor's callback is called.</P>
<H4>DSReq</H4>
<P><B>DSReq</B> is a wrapper around the <CODE>dsreq_t</CODE>; see <CITE>dslib(3X)</CITE>. The DSReq has the property that it automatically opens and closes the <KBD>/dev/scsi</KBD> device - there's no need to keep track of who opened it and who closes
it, and there's no way to introduce bugs by forgetting to put <CODE>dsclose()</CODE> into one code path.</P>
<H4>Log</H4>
<P>The <B>Log</B> class logs messages to syslog or to standard error.</P>
<H3>Devices, Partitions, Volumes and Addresses</H3>
<H4>DeviceAddress, SCSIAddress, PartitionAddress</H4>
<P>These are described above in the Design Overview section.</P>
<H4>DeviceInfo</H4>
<P>When mediad is probing for devices, it creates a <B>DeviceInfo</B> record and hands it to each of the device DSOs' instantiate routines. The
DeviceInfo is a grab bag of potentially useful info. It includes a H/W inventory
record, a DeviceAddress, and, for SCSI devices, the result of a SCSI INQUIRY
command.</P>
<H4>Device</H4>
<P><B>Device</B> is the abstract superclass from which device objects are derived. It has
a bunch of methods for obtaining info about the device and for controlling
the device.</P>
<P>Devices are enumerated. Whenever a MonitorClient receives an event, mediad
sends it a list of all Device objects. So a Device object is only created
when there's a real device that mediad is really monitoring.</P>
<P>Each device has three methods for returning its name. The methods are <CODE>short_name()</CODE>, <CODE>ftr_name()</CODE> and <CODE>dev_name()</CODE>. This is ugly, but necessary.</P>
<P>The <B>short name</B> is the common name of the device. It corresponds to objectserver's resourceObject
name attribute. Prepend a &quot;/&quot; to it to form the device's default mount point.
The short name has no punctuation characters. (e.g., <SAMP>CDROM</SAMP>, <SAMP>floppy2</SAMP>)</P>
<P>The <B>ftr name</B> is the name as it appears in the file type rules. Devices don't necessarily
have unique ftr names. For example, three CD-ROM drives would all have <SAMP>cdrom</SAMP> as their ftr name.</P>
<P>The <B>dev name</B> is the name of the <KBD>/dev</KBD> entry that should be used to open that device. The dev_name method takes
a filesystem format and a partition number as an argument. So, for example, <CODE>CDROM::fmt_name(FMT_CDDA, WholeDisk)</CODE> returns <KBD>/dev/scsi/sc<I>&lt;whatever&gt;</I></KBD>, while <CODE>CDROM::fmt_name(FMT_EFS, 7)</CODE> returns <KBD>/dev/dsk/dks<I>&lt;whatever&gt;</I>s7</KBD>.</P>
<H4>Partition</H4>
<P>A <B>Partition</B> is a piece of a disk. A partition has a format associated with it, either
one of the filesystem formats or &quot;raw&quot;. It also has sector info: sector
size, starting sector, and number of sectors. The last two are 64 bit integers.</P>
<P>Every device with media has one partition in raw format that describes the
total capacity of the media.</P>
<P>Partitions are enumerated. Whenever a MonitorClient receives an event, mediad
sends it a list of all Partition objects. So a Partition object is only
created when there's a real partition on a disk.</P>
<H4>Volume, SimpleVolume</H4>
<P>A <B>Volume</B> is a lot like a filesystem. Volume is an abstract base class. A volume
has one or more Partitions, a label, and info about how to mount it, in
the form of a <CODE>struct mntent</CODE>.</P>
<P><B>SimpleVolume</B> is the concrete subclass of Volume. It's a volume with one partition. Mediad
does not currently support multi-partition volumes, but the structure is
in place to add that support by defining a new subclass of Volume.</P>
<P>Volumes are enumerated. Whenever a MonitorClient receives an event, mediad
sends it a list of all Volume objects. So a Volume object is only created
when there's a real volume on disk(s). The volume doesn't have to be mounted.</P>
<H3>Core Objects</H3>
<H4>MediaDaemon</H4>
<P><B>MediaDaemon</B> is the object that probes for devices in the system and creates DeviceMonitors to monitor them. There is exactly one MediaDaemon object.</P>
<H4>DeviceMonitor</H4>
<P><B>DeviceMonitor</B> is the object that monitors one device. It wakes up periodically and checks
the device's state. When a medium is inserted, the DeviceMonitor calls each
of the FormatDSOs to inspect the medium. The FormatDSOs may create Volumes
and Partitions. When a medium is ejected, the DeviceMonitor destroys any
Volumes or Partitions associated with that device.</P>
<P>A DeviceMonitor responds to several commands, <CODE>activate()</CODE>, <CODE>deactivate()</CODE>, <CODE>suspend()</CODE>, <CODE>resume()</CODE>, and <CODE>eject()</CODE>. Eject is obvious. Activate/deactivate occur in response to <CITE>libmediad</CITE>'s release/get exclusive use functions. Suspend/resume occur when <KBD>mon=on/off</KBD> is set in <KBD>/etc/fsd.auto</KBD>.</P>
<H4>DeviceLibrary, FormatLibrary</H4>
<P>These are silly classes that maintain a list of all the device DSOs and
format DSOs. Both DSO libraries look in <KBD>/usr/lib/devicelib</KBD>, and find all files matching a pattern, either <KBD>dev_*.so</KBD> or <KBD>fmt_*.so</KBD>, respectively.</P>
<H4>DSO, DeviceDSO, FormatDSO</H4>
<P><B>DSO</B> is the abstract base class for a Dynamic Shared Object. It has methods
to load/unload, and to look up a symbol. These are just thin wrappers around
dlopen, dlclose and dlsym. The concrete subclasses are <B>DeviceDSO</B> and <B>FormatDSO</B>.</P>
<P>DeviceDSO has a method, <CODE>instantiate()</CODE>, that calls the DSO's instantiation routine. DeviceDSO maintains a reference
count of the number of instances each DSO has so that a DSO won't be unloaded
while instances exist.</P>
<P>FormatDSO has a method, <CODE>inspect()</CODE>, that calls the DSO's inspection routine.</P>
<H3>Client Interfaces</H3>
<H4>CompatListener, CompatClient</H4>
<P>The <B>CompatListener</B> listens for client connections from clients using the mediad/banyan interface.
It listens on a Unix domain socket. When it gets a connection, it creates
a CompatClient object. There is only one CompatListener object.</P>
<P>The <B>CompatClient</B> object handles a single session with an old-style client. Each session
consists of a single request-response pair. These are the requests.</P>
<UL>
<LI><VAR>MSG_EJECT</VAR>
<LI><VAR>MSG_TEST</VAR>
<LI><VAR>MSG_TERM</VAR>
<LI><VAR>MSG_SUSPENDON</VAR>
<LI><VAR>MSG_SUSPENDOFF</VAR>
<LI><VAR>MSG_SETLOGLEVEL</VAR>
<LI><VAR>MSG_STARTENTRY</VAR>
<LI><VAR>MSG_STOPENTRY</VAR>
</UL>
<H4>RPCListener, MonitorClient</H4>
<P>The <B>RPCListener</B> listens for RPC connections from monitor clients. When it gets one, it
creates a MonitorClient object. There is only one RPCListener object. The
protocol used is TCP/IP, so mediad will accept connections from remote clients.
(But only if the <KBD>share_devices</KBD> chkconfig option is on.)</P>
<P>A <B>MonitorClient</B> object handles a single session with a monitor client. When it first connects,
and when certain events happen, it sends a message to the client. These
are the events.</P>
<UL>
<LI><VAR>MCE_NO_EVENT</VAR>
<LI><VAR>MCE_INSERTION</VAR>
<LI><VAR>MCE_EJECTION</VAR>
<LI><VAR>MCE_REFORMAT</VAR>
<LI><VAR>MCE_MOUNT</VAR>
<LI><VAR>MCE_DISMOUNT</VAR>
<LI><VAR>MCE_NO_EVENT</VAR>
</UL>
<P>Each MonitorClient registers itself to receive callbacks from the mediad
core. The callbacks occur when a DeviceMonitor detects that a medium has
been inserted, ejected, or reformatted, and when mediad mounts or dismounts
a filesystem.</P>
<P>The message sent to the client is XDR-encoded. It has two main parts: an
event record and the system state. The event record has an event code and
either a device number (for an <VAR>MCE_INSERTION</VAR>, <VAR>MCE_EJECTION</VAR>, or <VAR>MCE_REFORMAT</VAR> event) or a volume number (for <VAR>MCE_MOUNT</VAR> or <VAR>MCE_DISMOUNT</VAR>). The system state is a list of all devices, all partitions, and all volumes
known to mediad, along with a variety of attributes about each.</P>
<H4>FSDMonitor</H4>
<P>The <B>FSDMonitor</B> is not yet implemented. It will monitor <KBD>/etc/fsd.auto</KBD> for changes using fam, and it will update mediad's state appropriately.
I'm not sure how it will work yet.</P>
<H3>DSOs</H3>
<H4>Device DSOs</H4>
<P>This section to be written. Ought to describe what the DSOs do in detail,
as they are <A HREF="#DSOs">above</A>.</P>
<H4>Format DSOs</H4>
<P>Ditto.</P>
<H2>Compact Discs</H2>
<P>This section to be written. CDs are ugly, and our CD support is ugly too.</P>
<H3>Invocation</H3>
<P>Mediad can be invoked several different ways. The executable figures out
how it was invoked and does the right thing.</P>
<P>Normally, mediad is started at boot time from <KBD>/etc/init.d/mediad</KBD>. In this mode, it scans the system for monitorable devices and, if it finds
any, sits and monitors them.</P>
<P>Mediad may also be invoked by <CITE>inetd(1M)</CITE>, in response to a monitor client's attempt to connect. In this case, mediad
tries to forward the connection to the real mediad, and if it can't, it
replies that there are no removable devices.</P>
<P>Mediad is also linked to the <KBD>eject</KBD> command. When invoked as eject, mediad tries to send an eject message to
the real mediad, using the CompatClient interface. If there is no other
mediad running, mediad probes the specific device requested, finds its DeviceDSO,
and tells the DeviceDSO to eject the medium. This has the advantage that
the same code is executed whether or not mediad is running, and eject is
automatically extended to new devices when mediad is.</P>
<P>Mediad can be invoked from the command line with a variety of options. Some
of the more common ones are:</P>
<UL>
<LI><KBD>mediad -k</KBD>
<LI><KBD>mediad -f</KBD>
<LI><KBD>mediad -l N</KBD>
<LI><KBD>mediad -p /dev/<I>&lt;whatever&gt;</I> <I>&lt;mountpoint&gt;</I></KBD>
<LI><KBD>mediad -r /dev/<I>&lt;whatever&gt;</I></KBD>
</UL>
<H2>Exclusive Use</H2>
<P>This section is to be written. Briefly, the exclusive use problem has been
solved, by changing all the clients that use it. Icons should be live all
the time. (It's not tested yet.) </P>
