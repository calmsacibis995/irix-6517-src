<TITLE>Moose Mediad Monitor Client API</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Moose Mediad Monitor Client Interface.</H1>
<P>This document explains mediad's new monitor client interface. This interface
is used to monitor the state of removable media devices. Both the API that
clients use and the formats and meanings of data structures passed to clients
are described.</P>
<P>The API allows a client to connect to mediad on any host, and to get a list
of removable media devices and the partitions and filesystems on those devices.
It also sends clients notification whenever the removable media state changes.
It does not allow the client to change the removable media state in any
way.</P>
<P>This interface is needed to replace objectserver. Prior to the moosehead
release, mediad sent all its state changes to objectserver, and other clients
such as the Indigo Magic Desktop or the Cadmin system administration tools
got that state from objectserver. There is no objectserver in the moosehead
release, so a different mechanism was needed.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Using the Monitor Client Interface</H2>
<P>A client may use this interface by linking with <KBD>libmediaclient.so</KBD>. libmediaclient is written in C, and it may be called from C or C++. (Probably
Fortran too, if you wanted to.)</P>
<H2>Client Data Structures</H2>
<P>The removable media state is encoded into four data structures, <DFN>mc_system</DFN>, <DFN>mc_device</DFN>, <DFN>mc_volume</DFN>, and <DFN>mc_partition</DFN>. Logically, a system contains a set of devices, volumes and partitions.
A device contains several partitions, and a volume resides on several partitions.
Figure one illustrates these relationships.</P>

<P>Volumes, devices and partitions have various attributes. Those are listed
here. The only ones described in detail are the device name fields.</P>
<PRE>
struct mc_volume {
    char *mcv_label;                /* volume label, if any */
    char *mcv_fsname;               /* e.g., /dev/dsk/dks... */
    char *mcv_dir;                  /* mount point */
    char *mcv_type;                 /* volume type (format), MC_FMT_xxx */
    char *mcv_subformat;            /* volume subformat, MC_SBFMT_xxx */
    char *mcv_mntopts;              /* mount options */
    unsigned int mcv_nparts;        /* number of partition ptrs */
    mc_partition_t **mcv_parts;     /* points to array of part. ptrs */
};

struct mc_device {
    char *mcd_name;                 /* device's short name */
    char *mcd_fullname;             /* device's printable name */
    char *mcd_ftrname;              /* device's name as used in FTRs */
    inventory_t mcd_invent;         /* device's H/W inventory record */
    mc_bool_t mcd_monitored;        /* is mediad monitoring it? */
    mc_bool_t mcd_media_present;    /* is media present? */
    mc_bool_t mcd_write_protected;  /* is device write-locked? */
    unsigned int mcd_nparts;        /* number of partition ptrs */
    mc_partition_t **mcd_parts;     /* points to array of part. ptrs */
};

struct mc_partition {
    mc_device_t *mcp_device;        /* device of which this is part */
    char *mcp_format;               /* partition format, MC_FMT_xxx */
    int mcp_index;                  /* partition # or MC_IX_WHOLE */
    unsigned int mcp_sectorsize;    /* size of sector in bytes */
    __uint64_t mcp_sector0;         /* starting sector number */
    __uint64_t mcp_nsectors;        /* number of sectors in part. */
};

struct mc_system {
   &#9;unsigned int    mcs_n_volumes;&#9; /* number of volumes in system */
   &#9;unsigned int    mcs_n_devices;&#9; /* number of devices in system */

    mc_partition_t *mcs_partitions;&#9;/* ptr to array of partitions */
};
</PRE>
<P>A device has an array of pointers to partitions. A volume also has an array
of partition pointers. A partition points to its containung device. An mc_system
is nothing but three arrays: an array of volumes, an array of devices, and
an array of partitions.</P>
<P>A device has three different names. <DFN>mcd_name</DFN> is a common, short name for the device, with no punctuation characters. <DFN>mcd_fullname</DFN> is the device's name in a more human readable format. But it is not internationalized. <DFN>mcd_ftrname</DFN> is the device's name as it appears in the file type rules, <KBD>/usr/lib/filetype/devices/devices.ftr</KBD>.</P>
<P>Note that no <KBD>/dev</KBD> entry is associated with a device. Instead, the <KBD>/dev</KBD> entry is associated with a volume. That's because different volumes on
the same device may be mounted using different mount points. E.g., a CD-ROM
would mount these filesystem types using these <KBD>/dev</KBD> entries.</P>
<PRE>
HFS   /dev/rdsk/dks0d4vol
  EFS   /dev/rdsk/dks0d4s7
  CDDA  /dev/scsi/sc0d4l0
</PRE>
<P>Every device that has media present has one mcd_partition of format &quot;raw&quot;.
That partition is not part of any volume; it describes the raw size of the
medium.</P>
<H2>Client API</H2>
<H3>Event Procedure</H3>
<PRE>
typedef void (*mc_event_proc_t)(mc_port_t, mc_closure_t, const mc_event_t *);
</PRE>
<P>The client must define an event procedure. This procedure will be called
when mediad is first connected to and whenever mediad has an event for the
client.</P>
<H3>Client Port</H3>
<PRE>
mc_port_t mc_create_port(u_long IPaddress, mc_event_proc_t, mc_closure_t); void mc_destroy_port(mc_port_t);
</PRE>
<P>To use the monitor interface, a client creates an mc_port. The mc_port makes
a connection to mediad, retrying until it's successful. When it gets connected,
it calls the client's event procedure. A port is created using mc_create_port()
and destroyed using mc_destroy_port().</P>
<PRE>
struct mc_what_next {
enum { MC_IDLE, MC_INPUT, MC_OUTPUT, MC_TIMEOUT } mcwn_what;
    /* N.B. MC_IDLE never seen */
    int mcwn_fd; /* descriptor for select */
    unsigned mcwn_seconds; /* timeout duration */
};

const mc_what_next_t *mc_execute(mc_port_t);
</PRE>
<P>The client has to give the port control at various times. To do so, the
client calls <CODE>mc_execute()</CODE>. <CODE>mc_execute()</CODE> returns a <CODE>mc_what_next</CODE> structure to inform the client when it should be called next. If the <CODE>mcwn_what</CODE> field is <CODE>MC_INPUT</CODE>, the client should call <CODE>mc_execute()</CODE> when the descriptor in the <CODE>mcwn_fd</CODE> field is readable, according to <CITE>select(2)</CITE>. If the <CODE>mcwn_what</CODE> field is <CODE>MC_OUTPUT</CODE>, the client should call <CODE>mc_execute()</CODE> when the descriptor is writable. If <CODE>mcwn_what</CODE> is <CODE>MC_TIMEOUT</CODE>, the client should sleep for <CODE>mcwn_seconds</CODE> seconds, then call <CODE>mc_execute()</CODE>.</P>
<P>The client's event procedure is called from <CODE>mc_execute()</CODE>.</P>
<H4>Alternate Port Creation Method</H4>
<PRE>
int mc_port_connect(mc_port_t);
</PRE>
<P>If your client doesn't need to do other processing asynchronously while
waiting to connect to mediad, it may use <CODE>mc_port_connect()</CODE> instead of repeatedly calling <CODE>mc_execute()</CODE> and <CODE>select()</CODE>. A client that uses mc_port_connect() would look like this.</P>
<PRE>
{
    mc_port_t port;

    /* ... */

    port = mc_create_port(...);
    int fd = mc_port_connect(port);

    /* <I>... application main loop ...</I> */
    /* <I>... select on fd for reading as long as</I>
           <I>mc_execute() returns MC_INPUT ...</I> */

    mc_destroy_port(port);

    /* ... */
}
</PRE>
<H3>Getting the System State</H3>
<PRE>
const mc_system_t *mc_system_state(mc_port_t);
</PRE>
<P><CODE>mc_system_state()</CODE> returns a pointer to an <CODE>mc_system</CODE> structure describing mediad's current state. If the client is not connected
to mediad, <CODE>mc_system_state()</CODE> returns NULL. The mc_system structure returned belongs to the port: the
client should not destroy it, and should not expect it to be preserved after
control flow returns to libmediaclient.</P>
<PRE>
mc_system_t *mc_dup_system(const mc_system_t *);
</PRE>
<P><KBD>mc_dup_system()</KBD> may be used to make a copy of a system's state. The new <KBD>mc_system</KBD> and related data structures belong to the caller, and should be freed by
the caller.</P>
<PRE>
void mc_destroy_system(mc_system_t *);
</PRE>
<P><KBD>mc_destroy_system()</KBD> is used to destroy an <KBD>mc_system</KBD> created by m<KBD>c_dup_system()</KBD>.</P>
<H2>Sample Client</H2>
<P>There is a sample client available. Its source is available at <KBD>/proj/???/isms/irix/cmd/mediad/clientmain.c</KBD>.</P>
