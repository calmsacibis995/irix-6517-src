These HTML documents are the internal documentation for mediad.  They
were written before mediad, and they have not been updated, so they're
somewhat inaccurate.

design.html		Moose Mediad Design Document

	Describes the problems mediad is trying to solve, and also
	describees mediad's overall design fairly well.

monitor_api.html	Moose Mediad Monitor Client Interface

	This is the best documentation there is on libmediaclient.
	If you read this, and read <mediaclient.h>, you'll know
	all there is to know about using that library.

config.html		Mediad Configuration File

	This describes the mediad config file.  This information is
	largely duplicated and superseded by the new mediad(1M) man
	page.
