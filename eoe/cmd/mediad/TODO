DONE	Ditch ::inv_addr.

DONE	Rewrite comments in Scheduler.H.

	Give task scheduling "slack".  Use cute subgenius quotes.

DONE	Remove or conditionalize iostream code.

DONE	Move code from init.C to MediaDaemon class.

DROP	Move the inquiry wart into DeviceInfo or into SCSIAddress.

DONE	Collapse Media and subclasses into Device and subclasses.

DONE	Just as Task was removed from Scheduler, IOHandler should be removed.

DROP	Make DeviceLibrary, FormatLibrary and DeviceList global.

DONE	Fold DeviceList into Device.

DONE	Fold VolumeList into Volume.

DONE	Fold PartitionList into Partition.

DONE	How soon should we unload the FormatDSO?  It's toast as soon as
	the volumes are mounted, if we store the mount point somewhere.
	I'm envisioning a FormatDSO looking at the media and instantiating
	some number of partitions and volumes through a pseudo-constructor.

DONE	Implement share_devices.

	Finish mount code.

DONE	Need more transitions in DeviceMonitor, specifically eject,
	stop monitoring, and start monitoring.

	Need to monitor independent mounts.

DONE	Remove "this code is crap" comment from fmt_hfs.C.  Also
	remove the justification for the comment.
