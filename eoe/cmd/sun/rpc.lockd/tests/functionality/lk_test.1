.SH NAME
lk_test \- test file and record locking functionality
.br
lk_test_svc \- file and record locking test server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lk_test
[-va] [localpath] [host:remotepath]
.br
.B lk_test_svc
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I lk_test
is an RPC client/server application designed to test the file
and record locking functionality of a UNIX file system.  The client,
\fIlk_test\fP, and the server, \fIlk_test_svc\fP,
form a pair of processes cooperating in the testing.  The
client is the active process in that the test phases are initiated by
the client.  The server is passive, waiting for the client to make
requests of it.
.P
All testing is performed in the current working directory for each
process unless a directory or test file has been specified by the argument
.IR localpath .
If
.I host:remotepath
has been supplied, the host name and the remote directory are taken
to be
.I host
and
.I remotepath
respectively.  Otherwise, the host name and the remote directory name
are determined from
.I localpath
or the current directory.  This is done by extracting the information
from the mounted file system table.
.P
If the host and remote path are to be specified, the local path must
also be specified, even if it is ".".
.P
Testing is divided into two phases.  In the first phase, exclusive
locking is tested.  In the second phase, shared locking is tested.
The first phase tests the locking and unlocking of the entire file
and of a portion of the file followed by tests of record locking
(locking a range of bytes within the file), overlapping lock requests,
and lock boundaries.  The second phase is similar to phase one with
variations for testing shared locking.
Where applicable, testing covers
.IR fcntl (2),
.IR lockf (3C),
and
.IR flock (3B).
.P
In all phases, verification of locking and unlocking is done by
requests to the process acting as the server.
.P
When testing a distributed file system such as NFS, the following
test scenarios must be executed (with three different systems):
.IP 1)
run
.B lk_test_svc
and
.B lk_test
on one client;
.IP 2)
run
.B lk_test_svc
on the file system server and
.B lk_test
on a single client;
.IP 3)
run
.B lk_test_svc
on one client and
.B lk_test
on a second client, with neither client being the file system server.
.SH OPTIONS
lk_test accepts the following options.
.TP 8
.B \-v
turn on verbose mode
.TP 8
.B \-a
use alternate lock verification.  Alternate lock verification uses F_SETLK
to verify lock acquisition as opposed to F_GETLK.
.P
.I lk_test_svc
accepts no options from the command line.  The
.B -v
option and the working directory name are passed to the server by the client
via an RPC call.
