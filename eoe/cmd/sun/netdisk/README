@(#)README	1.1 88/06/08 4.0NFSSRC (from 1.4 88/03/16 D/NFS)

Files in this directory provide the administrative support for
diskless/NFS servers.  They provide the means to load client
binaries from distribution tapes and to setup and administrate
the various files and directories required by the clients.

These programs are installed in /usr/etc/install by default.  If
this location is changed, you must change the Makefile install
location, plus change the PATH variable in the shell scripts to 
reflect the actual location.

The scripts 'INSTALL' and 'setup_exec' access the tape drive
specified by command line arguments.  The default blocking factor
is chosen depending on the tape type selected.  Your environment
may use other tape designations, so the comments concerning
TAPEDEV should be read in these two files.

Note also that the blocksize is specified in units of standard 512-byte
blocks, and that it is assumed that tar and dd share this understanding
of blocksize.  If this is not true in your enviroment, you will need to
make changes to remain consistent.  See the actual calls to tar and dd
in 'extracting' and adjust your parameters in order to maintain the
actual byte count required.  [This action will not be necessary in most
cases, but I am aware of at least one case where the block sizes are
different.]

To install, first type "make" in this directory, followed by
"make install".

The commands generated are:

INSTALL
	Main installation tool for loading distribution tapes, creating
	client trees, and putting required lines in administrative files.
	Calls other commands as needed.
convert_to_hex
	Utility to convert "dotted" IP address to hex format.  Called
	by other scripts.
create_root
	Script to set up a client's root partition on the server.  Called
	by setup_client, or may be used as a standalone command.
extracting
	Utility to actually extract a given tape file from a distribution
	tape.  Called by other scripts.
fix_bootparams
	Utility to update (add/remove) entries from the /etc/bootparams
	admin file.  Called by other scripts.
opt_software
	Program which knows how to read the table of contents from a
	distribution tape (local or remote) and presents the software
	choices to the user.  Constructs a load list which is used by
	setup_exec.  Called by other utilities.
setup_exec
	Main script which drives the loading of generic client software
	from the distribution tape onto the server.  Called by INSTALL,
	or may be used as a standalone command.
setup_client
	Main script which drives adding (or removing) a particular diskless
	client to (from) the server.  Called by INSTALL, or may be used
	as a standalone command.
verify_tapevol_arch
	Verifies that the currently loaded tape is the correct one.  Called
	by other scripts.
xdrtoc
	Utility which decodes the distribution tape table of contents into
	human readable form.  Used by verify_tapevol_arch to determine
	what tape is currently loaded.
