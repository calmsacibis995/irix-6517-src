#
# NFS exported filesystem database (see exports(4) for more information).
#
# Entries in this file consist of lines containing the following fields:
#
# filesystem	[ options ]	[ netgroup ] [ hostname ] ...
#
# Filesystem must be left-justified and may name any directory within a
# local filesystem.  A backslash (\) at the end of a line permits splitting
# long lines into shorter ones.  Netgroup(4) and hostname refer 
# to machines or collections of machines to which filesystem is exported.
