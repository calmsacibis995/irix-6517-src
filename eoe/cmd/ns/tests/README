The directory contains test cases to address following scenerios:

getXbyY() and getXent() - Single threaded
Tests are written in C for getXbyY(), getXbyY_r() and getXent().The _r
version are the reentrant versions.Each C test is wrapped around by a
perl script which excercise following scenerio on the C test.

1.Change the timestamp of the local file ( i.e. in case of
gethostbyname() touch the /etc/hosts file) and do lookup.
2.Add entries in the local file and do lookup.
3.Stop nsd and run the test and then restart nsd.
4.Wait for the cache timeout and run the test.
Each scenerio  can be repeated n times.

Configuration file (nsdswitch.conf) file changes:
This set of test cases include,
1.Change the lib order in the map entries in the nsswitch.conf file and
do lookup.
2.Try various combination of attribute values for each map entry and do 
lookup.

getXbyY() and getXent() - Multithreaded
Set of tests written in C calling getXbyY() and getXent() in
multithreaded env.


All the above test scenerios are enclosed in regression test suite-
regTestSuite.pl.
1.The result of each test case is stored in result file 
[result/test_name.res].At the end of test case it is compared with
[ref/test_name.res].Any difference is flaged.To begin with
[ref/test_name.res] can be created
very first time by using -init option of the regTestSuite.pl.
        ./regTestSuite.pl -init -all
The idea is to check the consistency of the results for each release 
of nsd.
2.The test suite can be run on multiple set of lookups or on all
        ./regTestSuite.pl -gethostbyname -getgrent
        ./regTestSuite.pl -all
3.It also check for nsd crashes and in such event sends email to 
appropriate developer.
4.It also checks for any of the lookup/list routine dumping core and
send email to the appropriate developer.
