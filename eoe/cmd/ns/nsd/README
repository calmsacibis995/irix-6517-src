		DO NOT DELETE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY

The files in this directory are mdbm files which holds a systemwide cache
of name-service results, and may be held open by long running processes.
Deleting these files will NOT free the disk space that is used, and will
NOT cause nsd or any other application that is running to flush their name
service cache that is contained in the file.

The command /sbin/mdbm_remove will safely and correctly mark the mdbm file
as invalid and unlink the file.   All running applications will notice this
on their next access of these caches, and do the right thing.   mdbm_remove
will only delete mdbm_files.
