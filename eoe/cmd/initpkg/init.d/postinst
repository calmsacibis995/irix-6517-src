# Check for & execute any uncompleted parts of an installation; this could
# happen if the inst succeeds but the system comes down abnormally.
# This must be done while local filesystems are mounted but while few
# other processes are active.  That time is early during startup, or late
# during shutdown.
#
# It is a safe no-op if no installation has been done.
