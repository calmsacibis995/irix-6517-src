# /etc/init.d contains initialization and termination scripts for
# changing init states.  These scripts are linked when appropriate to
# files in the /etc/rc?.d directories.  File names in rc?.d directories
# are of the form [SK]nn<init.d filename> where 'S' means start this job,
# 'K' means kill this job, and 'nn' is the relative sequence number for
# killing or starting the job.  When entering a state (init 0,2,3, etc.),
# the rc[0-6] script executes those scripts in /etc/rc[0-6].d that are
# prefixed with 'K' followed by those scripts prefixed with 'S'.
# 
# EXAMPLE: When changing to init state 2 (default multi-user mode),
# 	/etc/rc2 is initiated by the init process. The following
# 	steps are performed by /etc/rc2:
# 
# 	1. In the directory /etc/rc2.d are files used to stop processes 
# 	that should not be running in state 2.  The filenames
# 	are prefixed with 'K'.  Each 'K' file in the directory is
# 	executed (by /etc/rc2) in alpha-numeric order when the system 
# 	enters init state 2 (see example under next item).
# 
# 	2. Also in the /etc/rc2.d directory are files used to start
# 	processes that should be running in init state 2.  As in the step
# 	above, each 'S' file is executed in alpha-numeric order.
# 
# 	Example:
# 
# 		The file /etc/init.d/network is a script that will
# 		initiate networking daemons when given the argument
# 		'start', and will terminate the daemons if given the
# 		argument 'stop'.  It is linked to /etc/rc2.d/S30network
# 		and to /etc/rc0.d/K40network.  The file is executed by
# 		'/etc/rc2.d/S30network start' when init state 2 is
# 		entered and by '/etc/rc0.d/K40network stop' when
# 		shutting the system down.
# 
# 
# NOTE:  /etc/rc2 has references to the obsolescent 'rc.d' directory.
# These references are for compatibility with old INSTALL scripts. New
# INSTALL scripts should use the init.d directory for related
# executables.  The same is true for the shutdown.d directory.
