I<Programming Perl, Second Edition> is a reference work that covers
nearly all of Perl, while I<Learning Perl, Second Edition> is a
tutorial that covers the most frequently used subset of the language.
You might also check out the very handy, inexpensive, and compact
I<Perl 5 Desktop Reference>, especially when the thought of lugging
the 676-page Camel around doesn't make much sense.  I<Mastering
Regular Expressions>, by Jeffrey Friedl, is a reference work that
covers the art and implementation of regular expressions in various
languages including Perl.
