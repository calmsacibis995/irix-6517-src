# GNU CC on the Sparc assumes that doubles are 8 byte aligned.

Here are some notes kindly contributed by Dean Roehrich.

-----
Generic notes about building Perl5 on Solaris:
- Use /usr/ccs/bin/make.
- If you use GNU make, remove its setgid bit.
- Remove all instances of *ucb* from your path.
- Make sure libucb is not in /usr/lib (it should be in /usr/ucblib).
- Do not use GNU as or GNU ld, or any of GNU binutils or GNU libc.
- Do not use /usr/ucb/cc.
- Do not change Configure's default answers, except for the path names.
- Do not use -lmalloc.
- Do not build on SunOS 4 and expect it to work properly on SunOS 5.
- /dev/fd must be mounted if you want set-uid scripts to work.


Here are the gcc-related questions and answers from the Solaris 2 FAQ.  Note
the themes:
	- run fixincludes
	- run fixincludes correctly
	- don't use GNU as or GNU ld

Question 5.7 covers the __builtin_va_alist problem people are always seeing.
Question 6.1.3 covers the GNU as and GNU ld issues which are always biting
people.
Question 6.9 is for those who are still trying to compile Perl4.

The latest Solaris 2 FAQ can be found in the following locations:
	rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet-by-group/comp.sys.sun.admin
	ftp.fwi.uva.nl:/pub/solaris

Perl5 comes with a script in the top-level directory called "myconfig" which
will print a summary of the configuration in your config.sh.  My summary for
Solaris 2.4 and gcc 2.6.3 follows.  I have also built with gcc 2.7.0 and the
results are identical.  This configuration was generated with Configure's -d
option (take all defaults, don't bother prompting me).  All tests pass for
Perl5.001, patch.1m.

Summary of my perl5 (patchlevel 1) configuration:
  Platform:
    osname=solaris, osver=2.4, archname=sun4-solaris
    uname='sunos poplar 5.4 generic_101945-27 sun4d sparc '
    hint=recommended
  Compiler:
    cc='gcc', optimize='-O', ld='gcc'
    cppflags=''
    ccflags =''
    ldflags =''
    stdchar='unsigned char', d_stdstdio=define, usevfork=false
    voidflags=15, castflags=0, d_casti32=define, d_castneg=define
    intsize=4, alignbytes=8, usemymalloc=y, randbits=15
  Libraries:
    so=so
    libpth=/lib /usr/lib /usr/ccs/lib /usr/local/lib
    libs=-lsocket -lnsl -ldl -lm -lc -lcrypt
    libc=/usr/lib/libc.so
  Dynamic Linking:
    dlsrc=dl_dlopen.xs, dlext=so, d_dlsymun=undef
    cccdlflags='-fpic', ccdlflags=' ', lddlflags='-G'

Subject: Solaris 2 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 1.48
Date: 25 Jul 1995 12:20:18 GMT

5.7) Why do I get __builtin_va_alist or __builtin_va_arg_incr undefined?

    You're using gcc without properly installing the gcc fixed
    include files.  Or you ran fixincludes after installing gcc
    w/o moving the gcc supplied varargs.h and stdarg.h files
    out of the way and moving them back again later.  This often
    happens when people install gcc from a binary distribution.
    If there's a tmp directory in gcc's include directory, fixincludes
    didn't complete.  You should have run "just-fixinc" instead.

    Another possible cause is using ``gcc -I/usr/include.''

6.1) Where is the C compiler or where can I get one?

    [...]

    3) Gcc.

    Gcc is available from the GNU archives in source and binary
    form.  Look in a directory called sparc-sun-solaris2 for
    binaries.  You need gcc 2.3.3 or later.  You should not use
    GNU as or GNU ld.  Make sure you run just-fixinc if you use
    a binary distribution.  Better is to get a binary version and
    use that to bootstrap gcc from source.

    [...]

    When you install gcc, don't make the mistake of installing
    GNU binutils or GNU libc, they are not as capable as their
    counterparts you get with Solaris 2.x.

6.9) I can't get perl 4.036 to compile or run.

    Run Configure, and use the solaris_2_0 hints, *don't* use
    the solaris_2_1 hints and don't use the config.sh you may
    already have.  First you must make sure Configure and make
    don't find /usr/ucb/cc.  (It must use gcc or the native C
    compiler: /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc)

    Some questions need a special answer.

    Are your system (especially dbm) libraries compiled with gcc? [y] y

    yes: gcc 2.3.3 or later uses the standard calling
    conventions, same as Sun's C.

    Any additional cc flags? [ -traditional -Dvolatile=__volatile__
    -I/usr/ucbinclude] -traditional -Dvolatile=__volatile__
    Remove /usr/ucbinclude.

    Any additional libraries? [-lsocket -lnsl -ldbm -lmalloc -lm
    -lucb] -lsocket -lnsl  -lm

    Don't include -ldbm, -lmalloc and -lucb.

    Perl 5 compiled out of the box.
