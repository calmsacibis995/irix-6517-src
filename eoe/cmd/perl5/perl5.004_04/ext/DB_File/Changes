0.1

    First Release.

0.2

    When DB_File is opening a database file it no longer terminates the
    process if dbopen returned an error. This allows file protection
    errors to be caught at run time. Thanks to Judith Grass
    <grass@cybercash.com> for spotting the bug.

0.3

    Added prototype support for multiple btree compare callbacks.

1.0

    DB_File has been in use for over a year. To reflect that, the
    version number has been incremented to 1.0.

    Added complete support for multiple concurrent callbacks.

    Using the push method on an empty list didn't work properly. This
    has been fixed.

1.01

    Fixed a core dump problem with SunOS.

    The return value from TIEHASH wasn't set to NULL when dbopen
    returned an error.

1.02

    Merged OS/2 specific code into DB_File.xs

    Removed some redundant code in DB_File.xs.

    Documentation update.

    Allow negative subscripts with RECNO interface.

    Changed the default flags from O_RDWR to O_CREAT|O_RDWR.

    The example code which showed how to lock a database needed a call
    to sync added. Without it the resultant database file was empty.

    Added get_dup method.

1.03

    Documentation update.

    DB_File now imports the constants (O_RDWR, O_CREAT etc.) from Fcntl
    automatically.

    The standard hash function exists is now supported.

    Modified the behavior of get_dup. When it returns an associative
    array, the value is the count of the number of matching BTREE
    values.

1.04

    Minor documentation changes.

    Fixed a bug in hash_cb. Patches supplied by Dave Hammen,
    <hammen@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.govt>.

    Fixed a bug with the constructors for DB_File::HASHINFO,
    DB_File::BTREEINFO and DB_File::RECNOINFO. Also tidied up the
    constructors to make them -w clean.

    Reworked part of the test harness to be more locale friendly.

1.05

    Made all scripts in the documentation strict and -w clean.

    Added logic to DB_File.xs to allow the module to be built after
    Perl is installed.

1.06

    Minor namespace cleanup: Localized PrintBtree.

1.07

    Fixed bug with RECNO, where bval wasn't defaulting to "\n".

1.08

    Documented operation of bval.

1.09

    Minor bug fix in DB_File::HASHINFO, DB_File::RECNOINFO and
    DB_File::BTREEINFO.

    Changed default mode to 0666.

1.10

    Fixed fd method so that it still returns -1 for in-memory files
    when db 1.86 is used.

1.11

    Documented the untie gotcha.

1.12

    Documented the incompatibility with version 2 of Berkeley DB.

1.13

    Minor changes to DB_FIle.xs and DB_File.pm

1.14

    Made it illegal to tie an associative array to a RECNO database and
    an ordinary array to a HASH or BTREE database.

1.15

    Patch from Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no> to suppress "use of undefined
    value" warning with db_get and db_seq.

    Patch from Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no> to make DB_File export only the
    O_* constants from Fcntl.

    Removed the DESTROY method from the DB_File::HASHINFO module.

    Previously DB_File hard-wired the class name of any object that it
    created to "DB_File". This makes sub-classing difficult. Now
    DB_File creats objects in the namespace of the package it has been
    inherited into.


1.16

   A harmless looking tab was causing Makefile.PL to fail on AIX 3.2.5

    Small fix for the AIX strict C compiler XLC which doesn't like
    __attribute__ being defined via proto.h and redefined via db.h. Fix
    courtesy of Jarkko Hietaniemi.

1.50

    DB_File can now build with either DB 1.x or 2.x, but not both at
    the same time.

1.51

    Fixed the test harness so that it doesn't expect DB_File to have
    been installed by the main Perl build.


    Fixed a bug in mapping 1.x O_RDONLY flag to 2.x DB_RDONLY equivalent

1.52

   Patch from Nick Ing-Simmons now allows DB_File to build on NT.
   Merged 1.15 patch.

1.53

   Added DB_RENUMBER to flags for recno.

1.54

   Fixed a small bug in the test harness when run under win32
   The emulation of fd when useing DB 2.x was busted.

1.55
   Merged 1.16 changes.
