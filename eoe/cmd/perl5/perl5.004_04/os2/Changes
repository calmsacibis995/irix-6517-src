	PERLLIB_PREFIX was not active if it matches an element of @INC

	Do not need PERL_SBRK if crtdll-revision is >= 50.

:7: warning: #warning <dirent.h> requires <sys/types.h>
	We compile miniperl static. It cannot fork, thus there may be

	We compile perl___.exe A.OUT and dynamic. It should be able to
		fork.
	If we can fork, we my_popen by popen unless "-|". Thus we

		this.
	Apparently we can fork, and we can load dynamic extensions

	Segfault with system {'ls'} 'blah'; corrected.

after 5.003_07:
	custom tmpfile and tmpname which may use $TMP, $TEMP.
	all the calls to OS/2 API wrapped so that it is safe to use
		them under DOS (may die(), though).
	Tested that popen works under DOS with modified PDKSH and RSX.
	File::Copy works under DOS.
	MakeMaker modified to work under DOS (perlmain.c.tmp and sh -c true).

after 5.003_08:
	OS2::PrfDB exports symbols as documented;
	should work on OS/2 2.1 again.
	uses reliable signals when spawing.
	do not use popen() any more - no intermediate shell unless needed.

after 5.003_11:
	Functions emx_{malloc,realloc,calloc,free} are exported from DLL.
	get_sysinfo() bugs corrected (flags were not used and wrongly defined).

after 5.003_20:
	_isterm is substituted instead of isatty, s?random instead of srand.
	`register' disabled if -DDEBUGGING and not AOUT build: stupid SD386.
	3-argument select() was stomping over memory.

after 5.003_21:
	Can start scripts by executing 'dir/script' and
	'script.sh'. Form without extension will call shell only if
	the specified file exists (will not look on path) (to prohibit
	trying to run shell commands directly). - Needed by magic.t.

after 5.003_27:
	ALTERNATE_SHEBANG="extproc " supported, thus options on this
	line are processed (possibly twice). -S is made legal on such
	a line. This -S -x is not needed any more.
	perl.dll may be used from non-EMX programs (via PERL_SYS_INIT
	- the caller should have valid variable "env" with
	environment). Known problems: $$ does not work - is 0, waitpid
	returns immediately, thus Perl cannot wait for completion of
	started programs.

after 5.004_01:
	flock emulation added (disable by setting env PERL_USE_FLOCK=0),
		thanks to Rocco Caputo;
	RSX bug with missing waitpid circomvented;
	-S bug with full path with \ corrected.

before 5.004_02:
	-S switch to perl enables a search with additional extensions 
	.cmd, .btm, .bat, .pl as well.  This means that if you have
	mycmd.pl or mycmd.bat on PATH, 
		perl -S mycmd
	will work.  Perl will also look in the current directory first.
	Moreover, a bug with \; in PATH being non-separator is fixed.

after 5.004_03:
	$^E tracks calls to CRT now.  (May break if Perl masks some
	changes to errno?)
	$0 may be edited to longer lengths (at least under OS/2).
	OS2::REXX->loads looks in the OS/2-ish fashion too.
