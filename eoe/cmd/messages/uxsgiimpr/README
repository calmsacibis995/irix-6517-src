Impressario Message Catalog Header File

So that Impressario and impr_desktop products can be built standalone and
so that the distributed Impressario library source code will build,
a copy of the most current uxsgiimpr.h header file is checked in
the latest impressario trees. Currently, the only living tree is the
main OS tree (kudzu).

If you add a message to the catalog make sure to check in a copy
of the updated uxsgiimpr.h in:

/proj/<latest OS>/isms/impressario/include/msgs
