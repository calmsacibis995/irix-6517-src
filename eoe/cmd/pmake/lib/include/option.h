 * of '?'

    int		type;		/* Indicates option type;  see below */
    char	*key;		/* The key string that flags option */
    char *	address;	/* Address of variable to modify */

/*
 * Values for type:
 *
 *	OPT_CONSTANT(val) -	if the flag is present then set the
 *				associated (integer) variable to val.
 *				Val must be a non-negative integer.
 *	OPT_TRUE -		if the flag is present then set the
 *				associated (integer) variable to TRUE (1).
 *	OPT_FALSE -		if the flag is present then set the
 *				associated (integer) variable to FALSE (0).
 *	OPT_INT -		if the flag is present then the next argument
 *				on the command line is interpreted as an
 *				integer and that value is assigned to the
 *				options associated variable.
 *	OPT_STRING -		if the flag is present then the next argument
 *				on the command line is copied into the string
 *				variable associated with the option.
 *	OPT_REST -		if the flag is present, inhibit processing of
 *				later options, so that they're all returned
 *				to the caller in argv.  In addition, set the
 *				associated variable to the index of the first
 *				of these arguments in the returned argv.
 *				This permits a program to allow a flag to
 *				separate its own options from options it will
 *				pass to another program.
 *	OPT_FLOAT -		if the flag is present then the next argument
 *				on the command line is interpreted as a
 *				"double" and that value is assigned to the
 *				option's associated variable.
 *	OPT_FUNC -		if the flag is present, pass the next argument
 *				to "address" as a function. The function
 *				should be declared:
 *				    int
 *				    func(optString, arg)
 *					char 	*optString;
 *					char	*arg;
 *			    	Func should return non-zero if the argument
 *				was consumed or zero if not.  "optString" is
 *				the option key string that caused the
 *				function to be called and "arg" is the next
 *				argument (if there is no next argument then
 *				"arg" will be NULL).
 *	OPT_GENFUNC -		if the flag is present, pass the remaining
 *				arguments and the number of arguments to
 *				"address" as a function. The function should
 *				be declared:
 *				    int
 *				    func(optString, argc, argv)
 *					char *optString;
 *					int argc;
 *					char **argv;
 *				and should return the new number of arguments
 *				left in argv.  argv should have been shuffled
 *				to eliminate the arguments func consumed.
 *	OPT_DOC -		a dummy entry. Exists mostly for its
 *				documentation string.  As an additional side
 *				effect, if its key string an argument,
 *				Opt_Parse will treat it like a question mark
 *				(i.e. print out the program's usage and exit).
