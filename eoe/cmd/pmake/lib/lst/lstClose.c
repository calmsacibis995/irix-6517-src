 *	Close a list for sequential access.
 *	The sequential functions access the list in a slightly different way.
 *	CurPtr points to their idea of the current node in the list and they
 *	access the list based on it. Because the list is circular, Lst_Next
 *	and Lst_Prev will go around the list forever. Lst_IsAtEnd must be
 *	used to determine when to stop.
