     NAME
          mkisofs - create a iso9660  filesystem with optional Rock
          Ridge attributes.

     SYNOPSIS
          mkisofs [ -R ] [ -T ] [ -v ] [ -z ] [ -a ] [ -f ] [ -d ] [
          -D ] [ -l ] [ -V ] [ -V volid ] [ -p preparer ] [ -P
          publisher ] [ -A application_id ] [ -x path ] -o filename
          path

     DESCRIPTION
          mkisofs is effectively a pre-mastering program to generate
          the iso9660 filesystem -  it takes a snapshot of a given
          directory tree, and generates a binary image which will
          correspond to an iso9660 filesystem when written to a block
          device.

          mkisofs is also capable of generating the System Use Sharing
          Protocol records specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange
          Protocol.  This is used to further describe the files in the
          iso9660 filesystem to a unix host, and provides information
          such as longer filenames, uid/gid, posix permissions, and
          block and character devices.

          Each file written to the iso9660 filesystem must have a
          filename in the 8.3 format (8 characters, period, 3
          characters, all upper case), even if Rock Ridge is in use.
          This filename is used on systems that are not able to make
          use of the Rock Ridge extensions (such as MS-DOS), and each
          filename in each directory must be different from the other
          filenames in the same directory.  mkisofs generally tries to
          form correct names by forcing the unix filename to upper
          case and truncating as required, but often times this yields
          unsatisfactory results when there are  cases where the
          truncated names are  not  all unique. mkisofs assigns
          weightings to each filename, and if two names that are
          otherwise the same are found the name with the lower
          priority is renamed  to have a 3 digit number as an
          extension (where the number is guaranteed to be unique).  An
          example of this would be the files foo.bar and foo.bar.~1~ -
          the file foo.bar.~1~ would be  written  as FOO.000;1 and the
          file foo.bar would be written as  FOO.BAR;1

          path is the path of the directory tree to be copied into the
          iso9660 filesystem.

     OPTIONS
          -a   Include all files on the iso9660 filesystem.  Normally
               files that contain the characters '~' or '#' will not
               be included (these are typically backup files for
               editors under unix).

     MKISOFS(8)         Version 1.03 (August 1993)          MKISOFS(8)



          -A application_id
               Specifies a text string that will be written into the
               volume header.  This should describe the application
               that will be on the disc.  There is space on the disc
               for 128 characters of information.  This parameter can
               also be set in the file .mkisofsrc with APPL=id.  If
               specified in both places, the command line version is
               used.

          -d   Omit trailing period from files that do not have a
               period.  This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it
               happens to work on many systems.  Use with caution.

          -D   Do not use deep directory relocation, and instead just
               pack them in the way we see them.  This violates the
               ISO9660 standard, but it works on many systems.  Use
               with caution.

          -f   Follow symbolic links when generating the filesystem.
               When this option is not in use, symbolic links will be
               entered using Rock Ridge if enabled, otherwise the file
               will be ignored.

          -l   Allow full 32 character filenames.  Normally the
               ISO9660 filename will be in an 8.3 format which is
               compatible with MS-DOS, even though the ISO9660
               standard allows filenames of up to 32 characters.  If
               you use this option, the disc may be difficult to use
               on a MS-DOS system, but this comes in handy on some
               other systems (such as the Amiga).  Use with caution.

          -N   Omit version numbers from ISO9660 file names.  This may
               violate the ISO9660 standard, but no one really uses
               the version numbers anyway.  Use with caution.

          -o filename
               is the name of the file to which the iso9660 filesystem
               image should be written.  This can be a disk file, a
               tape drive, or it can correspond directly to the device
               name of the optical disc writer.  If not specified,
               stdout is ]used.  Note that the output can also be a
               block special device for a regular disk  drive, in
               which case  the disk partition can be mounted  and
               examined to ensure that the premastering was done
               correctly.

          -P publisher_id
               Specifies a text string that will be written into the
               volume header.  This should describe the publisher of
               the CDROM, usually with a mailing address and phone
               number.  There is space on the disc for 128 characters
               of information.  This parameter can also be set in the

     MKISOFS(8)         Version 1.03 (August 1993)          MKISOFS(8)



               file version is used.

          -p preparer_id
               Specifies a text string that will be written into the
               volume header.  This should describe the preparer of
               the CDROM, usually with a mailing address and phone
               number.  There is space on the disc for 128 characters
               of information.  This parameter can also be set in the
               file line version is used.

          -R   Generate SUSP and RR records using the Rock Ridge
               protocol to further describe the files on the iso9660
               filesystem.

          -T   Generate a file TRANS.TBL in each directory on the
               CDROM, which can be used on non-Rock Ridge capable
               systems to help establish the correct file names.
               There is also information present in the file that
               indicates the major and minor numbers for block and
               character devices, and each symlink has the name of the
               link file given.

          -V volid
               Specifies the volume ID to be written into the master
               block.  This parameter can also be set in the file
               .mkisofsrc with VOLI=id.  If specified in both places,
               the command line version is used.

          -v   Verbose execution.

          -x path
               Exclude path from being written to CDROM. path must be
               the complete pathname that results from concatenating
               the pathname given as command line argument and the
               path relative to this directory.  Multiple paths may be
               excluded (up to 1000).  Example:

               mkisofs -o cd -x /local/dir1 -x /local/dir2 /local

          -z   Generate special SUSP records for transparently
               compressed files.  This is only of use and interest for
               hosts that support transparent decompression.  This is
               an experimental feature, and no hosts yet support this,
               but there are ALPHA patches for linux that can make use
               of this feature.

     CONFIGURATION
          mkisofs looks for a file .mkisofsrc, first in the current
          working directory, and if not found there then in the
          directory in which the mkisofs binary is stored.  This file
          is assumed to contain a series of lines of the form
          "TAG=value", and in this way you can specify certain

     MKISOFS(8)         Version 1.03 (August 1993)          MKISOFS(8)



          options.  Only the first four characters of the tag are
          used, and the case of the tag is not significant.  Some
          fields in the volume header are not settable on the command
          line, but can be altered through this facility.  These are
          the copyright information (COPY), the bibliographic
          information (BIBL), the abstract (ABST), the volume set ID
          (VOLS) and the system ID (SYSI).

          mkisofs can also be configured at compile time with defaults
          for many of these fields.  See the file defaults.h.

     AUTHOR
          mkisofs is not based on the standard mk*fs tools for unix,
          because we must generate a complete  copy of an existing
          filesystem on a disk in the  iso9660 filesystem.   The  name
          mkisofs  is probably a bit of a misnomer, since it not only
          creates the filesystem, but it also populates it as well.

          Eric Youngdale <ericy@cais.com> wrote both the linux
          isofs9660 filesystem and the mkisofs utility, and is
          currently maintaining them.  The copyright for the mkisofs
          utility is held by Yggdrasil Computing, Incorporated.

     BUGS
          Any files that have hard links to files not in the tree
          being copied to the iso9660 filessytem will have an
          incorrect file reference count.

          There may be some other ones.  Please, report them to the
          author.

     FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
          Allow specfication of multiple paths on the command line to
          be included in iso9660 filesystem.  Can be tricky -
          directory entries in the root directory need to be properly
          sorted.

     AVAILABILITY
          mkisofs is available for anonymous ftp from tsx-11.mit.edu
          in /pub/linux/BETA/cdrom/mkisofs and many other mirror
          sites.  With the 1.0 release, it is no longer considered to
          be in beta testing.  Most of the bugs that are being
          discovered now are very minor (and interestingly enough also
          seem to be present in the YM software).  Reports indicate
          that people are gearing up for production runs using version
          1.00.
