/*
 * This describes the protocol used by the talk server and clients.
 *
 * The talk server acts a repository of invitations, responding to
 * requests by clients wishing to rendezvous for the purpose of
 * holding a conversation.  In normal operation, a client, the caller,
 * initiates a rendezvous by sending a CTL_MSG to the server of
 * type LOOK_UP.  This causes the server to search its invitation
 * tables to check if an invitation currently exists for the caller
 * (to speak to the callee specified in the message).  If the lookup
 * fails, the caller then sends an ANNOUNCE message causing the server
 * to broadcast an announcement on the callee's login ports requesting
 * contact.  When the callee responds, the local server uses the
 * recorded invitation to respond with the appropriate rendezvous
 * address and the caller and callee client programs establish a
 * stream connection through which the conversation takes place.
