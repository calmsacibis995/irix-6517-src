Frame Scheduler Device Driver Example
=====================================

Device drivers may be written to supply a time-base interrupt to the
Frame Scheduler.

This example shows how to interface generic IRIX6.4 **64-bit** device
drivers to the Frame Scheduler. The example is a pseudo-driver that
fakes a hardware interrupt using the inter-cpu group interrupt
facility. In the case of a real driver, the hardware device would
generate the interrupt directly.

If you are not using the driver on an IP27 based machine then you need
to modify the SYS_ARCH_TYPE definition in the driver.mk file, replacing the
architecture parameters with those of the target system (see driver.mk for
optional parameter definitions).

To build and install, type the following at the superuser command prompt:

	export ROOT=/ 		# if using ksh		
	export TOOLROOT=/       # if using ksh
	make -f driver.mk install

Then reboot the system.

If the example Frame Scheduler driver was successfully loaded, you will
see the following message appear on the console as the system is booting:

	"Frame Scheduler example driver (frsdrv) is installed"

Once the system has rebooted and the driver is loaded, type the following
at the superuser command prompt:

	ln -s /hw/frsdrv /dev/frsdrv

Use the example in /usr/react/src/examples/dintr to test this driver.
