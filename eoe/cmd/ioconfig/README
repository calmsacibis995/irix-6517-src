#Format:   <class> <type> <state> <suffix> <pattern>  <start_num> <ioctl_num>
#
#<type> 	can be -1 if the <class> itself is enough to uniquely identify the 
#		device
#<state> 	can be -1 if <class> & <type> uniquely identify the device
#<suffix> 	can be -1 in which case ioconfig ignores it
#<pattern> 	can be -1 in which case ioconfig takes the basename of the canonical
# 	   	name of the device that it is looking at
#<ioctl> 	can be -1 in which case ioconfig doesnot make the devicedriver
#	 	specific ioctl
#
# For a particular device the more generic entries should appear first in 
# the corresponding device file.
# Eg:- For a network device consider the entries
# 	<class>		<type>		<state>
#<e1> INV_NETWORK  	IGNORE 		IGNORE	.......	
#<e2> INV_NETWORK	INV_ETHER_EF	IGNORE	.......
# 
#since <e2> is more specific than <e1> in the sense that <type> is also
#specified <e1> MUST appear before <e2> for <e2> to have any effect.
