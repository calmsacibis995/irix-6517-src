This directory contains tools.  Do not attempt to actually build
anything in this directory.

The Build script allows you to specify a site configuration file by using
the -f flag:

	Build -f siteconfig.m4

You can put such site configuration files in the Site sub-directory;
see Site/README for details.

While building a site configuration file, you can add to a definition
using the APPENDDEF() and PREPENDDEF() macros.  For example:

	APPENDDEF(`confINCDIRS', `-I/usr/local/bind/include')

will add -I/usr/local/bind/include to the already existing confINCDIRS.
Note: There must be no trailing spaces after the last quote mark and
before the closing parenthesis.  Also you may need to properly quote
m4 reserved words as specified by your vendor's m4 command.

By default, sendmail will search your system for include and library
directories as well as certain libraries (libdb.* for Berkeley DB and
libbind.a or libresolv.* for name resolution).  You can turn off this
configuration step by specifying the -S flag with the Build command.

The OS subtree contains definitions for variations on a standard
model for system installation.  The M4 variables that can be defined
and their defaults before referencing the appropriate OS definitons
are:

confBEFORE	    [empty]		Files to create before sendmail is
					compiled.  The methods must be defined
					in the Makefile using PUSHDIVERT(3).

					The location of the build support
					binaries, relative to the obj.*
					directory.
confCC		    cc			The C compiler to use.
confOPTIMIZE	    -O			Flags passed to CC as ${O}.
confDEPEND_TYPE	    generic		How to build dependencies.  This should
					be the name of a file in
					BuildTools/M4/depend
confEBINDIR	    /usr/libexec	The location for binaries executed
					from other binaries, e.g., mail.local
					or smrsh.
confENVDEF	    [empty]		-D flags passed to cc.

					linking with programs.

		    ${UBINDIR}/hoststat ${UBINDIR}/purgestat
					Names of links to sendmail.

confMAN1	    confMANROOT 1	The location of man1 files.
confMAN1EXT	    1			The extension on files in confMAN1.
confMAN1SRC	    0			The source for man pages installed
					in confMAN1.
confMAN5	    confMANROOT 5	The location of man5 files.
confMAN5EXT	    5			The extension on files in confMAN5.
confMAN5SRC	    0			The source for man pages installed
					in confMAN5.
confMAN8	    confMANROOT 8	The location of man8 files.
confMAN8EXT	    8			The extension on files in confMAN8.
confMAN8SRC	    0			The source for man pages installed
					in confMAN8.
confMANDOC	    -mandoc		The macros used to format man pages.
confMANOWN	    bin			The owner of installed man pages.
confMANGRP	    bin			The group of installed man pages.
confMANMODE	    444			The mode of installed man pages.
confMAPDEF	    [varies]		The map definitions, e.g.,
					-DNDBM -DNEWDB.  -DNEWDB is always
					added if a libdb.a can be found.
confNO_MAN_INSTALL  [undefined]		If defined, don't install the man
					pages by default.
confMBINDIR	    /usr/sbin		The location of the MTA (sendmail)
					binary.
