.Nd store mail in a mailbox
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mail.local
.Op Fl f Ar from
.Ar user ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Mail.local
reads the standard input up to an end-of-file and appends it to each
.Ar user's
.Pa mail
file.
The
.Ar user
must be a valid user name.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xxxfrom
.It Fl f Ar from
Specify the sender's name.
.El
.Pp
Individual mail messages in the mailbox are delimited by an empty
line followed by a line beginning with the string ``From ''.
A line containing the string ``From '', the sender's name and a time stamp
is prepended to each delivered mail message.
A blank line is appended to each message.
A greater-than character (``>'') is prepended to any line in the message
which could be mistaken for a ``From '' delimiter line
(that is,
a line beginning with the five characters
``From '' following a blank line).
.Pp
The mail files are exclusively locked with 
.Xr flock 2
while mail is appended,
and a
.Pa user.lock
file also is created while the mailbox is locked
for compatibility with older MUAs.
.Pp
If the ``biff'' service is returned by
.Xr getservbyname 3 ,
the biff server is notified of delivered mail.
.Pp
The
.Nm mail.local
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
