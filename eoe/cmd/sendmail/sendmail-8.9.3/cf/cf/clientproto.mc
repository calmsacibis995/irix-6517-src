#
#  This the prototype for a "null client" -- that is, a client that
#  does nothing except forward all mail to a mail hub.  IT IS NOT
#  USABLE AS IS!!!
#
#  To use this, you MUST use the nullclient feature with the name of
#  the mail hub as its argument.  You MUST also define an `OSTYPE' to
#  define the location of the queue directories and the like.
#  In addition, you MAY select the nocanonify feature.  This causes
#  addresses to be sent unqualified via the SMTP connection; normally
#  they are qualifed with the masquerade name, which defaults to the
#  name of the hub machine.
#  Other than these, it should never contain any other lines.
