NAME
	getcatNAME.tests

DESCRIPTION
	This directory contains test manual pages that have proved to be
	problematic for getcatNAME in the past. These pages need to be
	filtered through getcatNAME and the results checked to verify
	that there are no regressions.

	The main Makefile in the parent "man" directory acts as the
	test driver and performs the comparisons against the reference
	file, getcatNAME.out.ref.

FILES
	getcatNAME.out.ref ....	reference output from getcatNAME

	badheader.man ......... a manual page with a badly formatted header
	c++section.man ........ a C++ manual page with a (3C++) section number
	nosection.man ......... a manual page with no section header
