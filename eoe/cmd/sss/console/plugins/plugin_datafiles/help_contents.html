    <LI>The <font face="Courier"><TT>Archive</TT></font> database option conserves disk space by compressing the 
    current database. The SGI Embedded Support Partner can continue to read the compressed data. To ensure data 
    integrity, you must execute the command <font face="Courier"><TT>esparchive</TT></font> from a command line. 
    All Embedded Support Partner daemons are shut down during this operation and will be automatically restarted 
    when archiving is completed. Archiving is possible only when the size of the current database is at least 
    10 megabytes; the compression mechanism will not work if you try to archive a smaller database.<p> 
    <LI>The <font face="Courier"><TT>Delete Database</TT></font> option deletes an archived database that you no 
    longer need.

<b>SYSTEM INFORMATION &gt; Hardware</b>
<P>Use this command to display the hardware configuration of the system, 
which existed at a specific time on a specific date.</P>
<p>Hardware configuration information is available for the following systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP19 - Challenge/Onyx
<li>IP21 - Power Challenge/Power Onyx
<Li>IP25 - Power Challenge 10000/Power Onyx 10000
<li>IP27 - Origin2000/Onyx2
<li>IP29 - Origin200
<li>IP30 - Octane
<li>IP32 - O2
</ul>
<P>If you are interested in hardware information for a specific date/time, enter the desired date/time in the 
appropriate field. Otherwise, the information displayed is as of 23:59:59 for the current date or the latest available.</p>
<p>Note: The current date means the date that your system displays.</p>
<p>You must select a database that corresponds to the date that you specified.<p>
<p>For a <b>Group of Systems</b>, choose the system whose hardware information you want.</p>
<P>If you have changed the query date or time, this report displays a table of the 
hardware components that form the selected configuration. The information is displayed in a hierarchical manner.
If information is not available or not applicable, &#034;N/A&#034; is displayed.</P>
<P>The first column of the report table can include one or more of the following symbols: a double arrow
(<img src="/images/double_arrow_right.gif" alt="double arrow">), a single arrow that points to the right 
(<img src="/images/arrow_right.gif" alt="right arrow">), or a single arrow that points down (<img src="/images/arrow_down.gif" alt="down arrow">). 
Clicking on a double arrow fully expands a particular entry and all of the components and subcomponents below it. For the Origin2000 and Onyx2
series double error expands only one module and its components. Clicking on a right arrow expands the 
table to display the subcomponents that compose the selected component. Clicking on a down arrow collapses the subcomponent display.</P>

<P>This option is available for <b>Group of Systems</b> only. Subscription is the process by which a Systems Group Manager
requests a remote system that is running SGI Embedded Support Partner to forward events that occur on the remote system. Subscription
is done based on Events that are recognized on the remote host. Events can be individually subscribed with some exceptions. For
example, all Availability class events are subscribed together. This is done to provide accurate availability statistics.
Once an event is subscribed, the remote host forwards any occurrences of the event to Group Manager, which enables the Systems Group
Manager to act as a central repository of information for different remote systems.</P>
<P>Unsubscription is the reverse of Subscription. It is the process by which Systems Group Manager informs a remote system
that it is no longer interested in the events that were subscribed earlier.</P>
<A NAME="setup_events_subscribe1">&nbsp;<p></A>
Once you enter a hostname and choose subscribe or unsubscribe, you must select a class that you want to operate upon.

the SGI Embedded Support Partner database, which runs as Systems Group Manager.</P>
<A NAME="setup_events_subscribe2">&nbsp;<p></A>
After a class is selected, all the events that are available for that class are presented. 
You may subscribe or unsubscribe certain classes of events only in full. For these classes, the list of events will

<P>For subscription, the list of events is obtained from the remote host. If the same class was subscribed before,

configuration parameters. All the parameters are written to <font face="Courier"><TT>/etc/qpage.cf</tt></font> file.</p>

to deliver a page. The Modem/Admin section enables modem configuration. The Service section enables configuration of the parameters 
of the Paging Service Provider(s). Because the service provider normally identifies each individual pager by means of a pager ID 
(which does not have to be the pager Touch-tone number), a pager ID must be provided in order to deliver the page. The Pager section

<b>SETUP &gt; System Monitoring</b>
<p>System Monitoring is available only for a <b>Group of Systems</b>. It is a facility that is packaged with SGI
Performance Co-Pilot software tools (pcp_eoe). It enables monitoring of selected services on a remote machine from Embedded 
Support Partner. In order to monitor a service, a hostname and a command must be provided. This command, 
when it is executed on the machine that is running Embedded Support Partner, obtains information about the selected
service on the remote machine.</p>
<p>The System Monitoring facility of Performance Co-Pilot can be configured via the SGI Embedded Support Partner User
Interface. This option is available only if SGI Embedded Support Partner is running as a Group Manager.</p>
<p>Embedded Support Partner User Interface provides 2 different screens for configuring System Monitoring. The Service
section of System Monitoring allows you to add a new service or update an existing service, or delete an existing service. The
Service section provides more details on how these operations can be performed. After a service has been added, you can add 
this service to a host by using the Hosts screen of System Monitoring. This action enables monitoring of that particular service
for the host. The Hosts section provides more information on how services can be associated with hosts.</P>
