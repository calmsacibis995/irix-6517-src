    <td><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The System Information section of SGI Embedded Support Partner User 
Interface provides access to the data collected by various ESP daemons. 
This data is grouped into various reports. All available reports 
provide an option to walk across archived data, if available. A subset 
of available data can be requested by giving appropriate time range. 
The available reports include:</P>

    system (and if applicable, subscribed systems).
    <LI>
