<b>Embedded Support Partner ASCII console usage notes</b>
<p>The SGI Embedded Support Partner ASCII console is a set of means 
   that provides access to the SGI Embedded Support Partner 
   facilities for users running cursor-addressable, 
   character-cell display devices (e.g., vt100 terminals, 
   vt100 emulators, or any other "curses-oriented" displays). 

<p>In order to operate the Embedded Support Partner User Interface 
   from such display device, the Lynx WEB browser must be used. 
   It is expected that the executable file of Lynx browser will be 
   installed into /usr/local/bin subdirectory. Please, refer
   to the Lynx's documentation about the installation of this
   browser. 
  
<p>Since there are significant differences between usage of
   graphics-based Web Browser (Netscape) and ascii-based 
   Web Browser (Lynx) it is strongly recommended for a person 
   who does not have previous experience of working with Lynx 
   to refer to the documentation about general usage of this 
   WEB Browser as well as intradocument and interdocument 
   navigation.
   
<p>Due to dynamic nature of the user interface it is essential 
   to ensure that the HTML pages displayed by Lynx are current 
   and have not been loaded from Lynx's cache.
   
<p>To ensure that you have to follow a few simple rules:
  
   <ol><li>Use "x" (NOCACHE on keymap) to activate links on the page 
   to ensure that this page is loaded from the server and not from 
   the cache.
   
   <li>If you used "Backspace" or "Delete" ("HISTORY" on keymap) to 
   get history of the visited pages, you can must "x" (NOCACHE) to 
   return to the page that you selected.
    
   <li>If you used "PREV_DOC" key to return to the previous document and 
   you need to refresh this page, hit "Backspace" then "x" to do the job.
   </ol>
   
<p><b>Tip.</b> Press "k" to get current key assignment.

<b>SETUP &gt; Availability Monitoring</b>
<p>The Availability Monitoring is a set of tools that collectivly monitor and report the availability of
system(s) and diagnosis of system crashes. Availability monitoring tools gather information from diagnostic
programs like ICRASH, FRU Analyzer, SYSLOG and identify the cause of system shutdowns. The system configuration
information comes from configmon, hinv and versions. Availability monitoring tools can report data to various locations
based on the Availability MailList setting.

<b>SETUP &gt; Performance Monitoring &gt; Configuration</b>
<p>There is a set of rules available to set up for performance monitoring.</p>
<p>The table below provides a short description for each rule:</p>

<p><pre>   <b>cpu.context_switch</b>          High aggregate context switch rate</pre>
  
  Average number of context switches per CPU per second exceeded threshold over the past sample interval.
  
<p><pre>   <b>cpu.excess_fpe</b>                 Possible high floating point exception rate</pre>
  
  This predicate attempts to detect processes generating very large 
  numbers of floating point exceptions (FPEs).  Characteristic of
  this situation is heavy system time coupled with low system call
  rates (exceptions are delivered through the kernel to the process,
  taking some system time, but no system call is serviced on the
  application's behalf).
  
<p><pre>   <b>cpu.load_average</b>            High 1-minute load average</pre>
  
  The current 1-minute load average is higher than the larger of
  min_load and ( per_cpu_load times the number of CPUs ).
  The load average measures the number of processes that are running,
  runnable or soon to be runnable (i.e. in short term sleep).
  
<p><pre>   <b>cpu.low_util</b>                Low average processor utilization</pre>
  
  The average processor utilization over all CPUs was below threshold
  percent during the last sample interval.  
  This rule is effectively the opposite of cpu.util and is disabled by
  default - it is only useful in specialized environments where, for
  example, processing is batch oriented and low processor utilization
  is indicative of poor use of system resources.  In such a situation
  the cpu.low_util rule should be enabled, and cpu.util disabled.
  
<p><pre>   <b>cpu.syscall</b>                 High aggregate system call rate</pre>
  
  Average number of system calls per CPU per second exceeded
  threshold over the past sample interval.
 
 
<p><pre>   <b>cpu.system</b>                  Busy executing in system mode</pre>
  Over the last sample interval, the average utilization per CPU was
  busy percent or more, and the ratio of system time to busy time
  exceeded threshold percent.
  
<p><pre>   <b>cpu.util</b>                    High average processor utilization</pre>
  
  The average processor utilization over all CPUs exceeded threshold
  percent during the last sample interval.
  
  
<p><pre>   <b>craylink.node_cb_errs</b>       CrayLink checkbit errors on Origin node</pre>
  
  For some Origin 2000 node, at least one checkbit error was
  observed on the node (CrayLink) interface and/or the I/O interface in the last sample interval. Use the command
  <br><center>$ pminfo -f hinv.map.node</center> to discover the abbreviated PCP names of the installed nodes and
  their corresponding full names in the <b>/hw</b> file system.
  
<p><pre>   <b>craylink.router_cb_errs</b>     CrayLink checkbit errors on Origin route</pre>
  
  For some CrayLink router port, at least one checkbit error was
  observed in the last sample interval.  Use the command
  <br><center>$ pminfo -f hinv.map.routerport</center>
  to discover the abbreviated PCP names of the installed router ports
  and their corresponding full names in the <b>/hw</b> file system.
  
  
<p><pre>   <b>filesys.buffer_cache</b>        Low buffer cache read hit ratio</pre>
  
  Some filesystem read activity (at least min_lread Kbytes per
  second of logical reads), and the read hit ratio in the buffer
  cache is below threshold percent.Note:  It is possible for the read hit ratio to be negative
  more phsical reads than logical reads) - this can be as a result of:
        <ul><li>XLV striped volumes, where blocks span stripe boundaries
            <li>very large files, where the disk controller has to read
            blocks indirectly (multiple block reads to find a single
            data block result)
            <li>file system read-ahead pre-fetching blocks which are not
            subsequently read
        </ul>
        
<p><pre>   <b>filesys.dnlc_miss</b>           High directory name cache miss rate</pre>
  
  With at least min_lookup directory name cache (DNLC) lookups per
  second being performed, threshold percent of lookups result in
  cache misses.
  
  
<p><pre>   <b>filesys.filling</b>             File system is filling up</pre>
  Filesystem is at least threshold percent full and the used space
  is growing at a rate that would see the file system full within
  lead_time.
  
  
<p><pre>   <b>memory.exhausted</b>            Severe demand for real memory</pre>
  
  The system is swapping modified pages out of main memory to the
  swap partitions, and has been doing this at the rate of at least
  threshold pages swapped out per second for at least pct of the last
  10 samples, ie. sustained page out activity.
  
  
<p><pre>   <b>memory.swap_low</b>             Low free swap space</pre>
  
  There is only threshold percent swap space remaining - the system
  may soon run out of virtual memory.  Reduce the number and size of
  the running programs or add more swap(1) space before it completely
  runs out.
  
<p><pre>   <b>network.buffers</b>             Serious demand for network buffers</pre>
  
  During the last sample interval the rate at which processes tried to
  acquire network buffers (mbufs) and either failed or were stalled
  waiting for a buffer to be freed is greater than threshold times per
  second.
  
<p><pre>   <b>network.tcp_drop_connects</b>   High ratio of TCP connections dropped</pre>
  
  There is some TCP connection activity (at least min_close
  connections closed per minute) and the ratio of TCP dropped
  connections to all closed connections exceeds threshold percent
  during the last sample interval.  High drop rates indicate either
  network congestion (check the packet retransmission rate) or an
  application like a Web browser that is prone to terminating TCP
  connections prematurely, perhaps due to sluggish response or user
  impatience.
  
  
<p><pre>   <b>network.tcp_retransmit</b>      High number of TCP packet retransmissions</pre>
  
  There is some network output activity (at least 100 TCP packets per
  second) and the average ratio of retransmitted TCP packets to output
  TCP packets exceeds threshold percent during the last sample
  interval. High retransmission rates are suggestive of network congestion, or
  long latency between the end-points of the TCP connections.
  
<p><pre>   <b>per_cpu.context_switch</b>      High per CPU context switch rate</pre>
  
  The number of context switches per second for at least one CPU
  exceeded threshold over the past sample interval. This rule only applies to multi-processor systems, for
  single-processor systems refer to the cpu.context_switch rule. For Origin 200 and Origin 2000 systems, use the command
  <br><center>$ pminfo -f hinv.map.cpu</center> to discover the abbreviated PCP names of the installed CPUs and
  their corresponding full names in the <font face="Courier"><tt>/hw</tt></font> file system.
  
<p><pre>   <b>per_cpu.many_util</b>           High number of saturated processors</pre>
  
  The processor utilization for at least pct percent of the CPUs
  exceeded threshold percent during the last sample interval. Only applies to multi-processor systems having more than min_cpu_count
  processors - for single-processor systems refer to the cpu.util rule, for multi-processor systems with less than min_cpu_count
  processors refer to the per_cpu.some_util rule.
  
<p><pre>   <b>per_cpu.some_util</b>           High per CPU processor utilization</pre>
  
  The processor utilization for at least one CPU exceeded threshold
  percent during the last sample interval.  Only applies to multi-processor systems with less than max_cpu_count processors -
  for single-processor systems refer to the cpu.util rule, and for multi-processor systems with more than max_cpu_count processors
  refer to the cpu.many_util rule. For Origin 200 and Origin 2000 systems, use the command
  <br><center>$ pminfo -f hinv.map.cpu</center>to discover the abbreviated PCP names of the installed CPUs and
  their corresponding full names in the <font face="Courier"><tt>/hw</tt></font> file system.
  
<p><pre>   <b>per_cpu.syscall</b>             High per CPU system call rate</pre>
  
  The number of system calls per second for at least one CPU
  exceeded threshold over the past sample interval. This rule only applies to multi-processor systems, for
  single-processor systems refer to the cpu.syscall rule. For Origin 200 and Origin 2000 systems, use the command
  <br><center>$ pminfo -f hinv.map.cpu</center>to discover the abbreviated PCP names of the installed CPUs and
  their corresponding full names in the <font face="Courier"><tt>/hw</tt></font> file system.
  
  
<p><pre>   <b>per_cpu.system</b>              Some CPU busy executing in system mode</pre>
  
  Over the last sample interval, at least one CPU was active for
  busy percent or more, and the ratio of system time to busy time exceeded threshold percent. Only applies to multi-processor
  systems, for single-processor systems refer to the cpu.system rule. For Origin 200 and Origin 2000 systems, use the command
  <br><center>$ pminfo -f hinv.map.cpu</center>to discover the abbreviated PCP names of the installed CPUs and
  their corresponding full names in the <b>/hw</b> file system.
  
<p><pre>   <b>per_disk.util</b>               High per spindle disk utilization</pre>
  
   For at least one spindle, disk utilization exceeded threshold percent during the last sample interval.
        
<p><pre>   <b>per_netif.collisions</b>        High collision rate in packet sends</pre>
  More than threshold percent of the packets being sent across an
  interface are causing a collision, and packets are being sent across the interface at packet_rate packets per second.
  Ethernet interfaces expect a certain number of packet collisions, but a high ratio of collisions to packet sends is indicitive of a
  saturated network.
        
        
<p><pre>   <b>per_netif.errors</b>            High network interface error rate</pre>
  For at least one network interface, the error rate exceeded threshold errors per second during the last sample interval.
  
        
<p><pre>   <b>per_netif.packets</b>           High network interface packet transfers</pre>
  
  For at least one network interface, the average rate of packet
  transfers (in and/or out) exceeded the threshold during the last sample interval.
  This rule is disabled by default because the per_netif.util rule is more generally useful as it takes into consideration each
  network interfaces' reported bandwidth.  However, there are some situations in which this value is zero, in which case an absolute
  threshold-based rule like this one will make more sense (for this reason it should typically be applied to some network interfaces,
  but not others - use the "interfaces" variable to filter this).
  
  
<p><pre>   <b>per_netif.util</b>             High network interface utilization</pre>
  For at least one network interface, the average transfer rate (in
  and/or out) exceeded threshold percent of the peak bandwidth of the
  interface during the last sample interval.
  
  
<p><pre>   <b>rpc.bad_network</b>            RPC network transmission failure</pre>
  More than threshold percent of sent client remote procedure call
  (RPC) packets are timing out before the server responds and the
  number of timeouts is significantly more than the number of duplicate
  packets being received (indicating lost packets).
  The networked file system (NFS) utilizes the RPC protocol for its
  client-server communication needs.  This high failure rate when sending
  RPC packets may be due to faulty network hardware or inappropriately
  sized NFS packets (packets possibly too large).
  
<p><pre>   <b>rpc.slow_response</b>         RPC server response is slow</pre>
  
  More than threshold percent of sent client remote procedure call
  (RPC) packets are timing out before the server responds and the
  number of timeouts is roughly equivalent to the number of duplicate
  packets being received.
  The network file system (NFS) utilizes the RPC protocol for its
  client-server communication needs.  This high timeout rate when
  sending RPC packets may be because the NFS server is processing
  duplicate requests from the clients which were sent after the
  original requests timed out.
        
        
<p><pre>   <b>espping.response</b>           System Group Manager slow service response</pre>
  
        A service being monitored by the SGI Embedded Support Partner Group
        Manager has taken more than threshold milliseconds to complete, during the last sample interval.  The hosts parameter specifies
        hosts running the ssping PMDA, not hosts being monitored by this PMDA.  The latter are encoded in the "instances" for each
        espping PMDA metric - run<br><center>$ pminfo -f espping.cmd</center>to list the instances and values for the espping.cmd metric.
        
        
<p><pre>   <b>espping.status</b>             System Group Manager service probe failure</pre>
  
        A service being monitored by the SGI Embedded Support Partner Group
        Manager has either failed, or not responded within a timeout period (as defined by espping.control.timeout) during the last sample
        interval.  The hosts parameter specifies hosts running the espping PMDA, not hosts being monitored by this PMDA.  The latter are
        encoded in the "instances" for each espping PMDA metric - run<br><center>$ pminfo -f espping.cmd</center>to list the instances
        and values for the espping.cmd metric.
