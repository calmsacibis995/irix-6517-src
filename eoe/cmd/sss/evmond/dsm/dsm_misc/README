This directory contains code involved to initiate actions and to reconfigure
rules. These are files which were few enough that they did not suggest
creating a separate directory (instead of packing them together in the misc
directory) for them.

exec_dso.c     - implementation of exec_dso function, for executing dso 
                 libraries as actions. The dso itself has to follow an api to
                 be used.
dsm_dso.c      - Code to setup the arguments and call the above exec_dso 
                 function.
dsm_children.c - Code to setup the arguments to an action which is an executable
                 and execute it.
dsm_config.c   - Code to reconfigure rules in the dsm. When a rule 
                 reconfiguration event is received control reaches here.
