This directory contains the code for the pthreads interface of the SEM.

		
sss_pthreads.c - Code to actually use the pthreads library. If we move the 
		 SEM to another platform.. any platform dependencies have 
		 to be made here.

sss_pthreads.h - Source files which use the pthreads functions above have to
		 include this file.
