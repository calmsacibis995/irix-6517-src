This directory contains code involved for the SEH to handle events. 

seh_alarm.c    - Contains the alarm handler
			o the alarm handler becomes a thread if 
                          SSS_PTHREADS_NO_ALARM is used.
			o Also if we are running as pthreads as we are now.
			  the code here needs to call the event handler in the
                          DSM.

seh_events.c   - Contains code for the SEH mainly to do the normal throttling 
                 thresholding of events.

seh_init.c     - Contains initialization code for the SEH. This is responsible
                 for calling all the sub-modules initialization functions.
                 Control passes here only once in a SEH's lifetime to do the
                 initialization. 

seh_main.c     - Contains code for the main loop of the SEH thread/process.
                 Control stays here for the rest of the life of the SEH -- i.e.,
                 after initialization.
