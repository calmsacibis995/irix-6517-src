This directory contains code involved for the DSM to handle events. 

dsm_alarm.c    - Contains the alarm handler
			o the alarm handler becomes a thread if 
                          SSS_PTHREADS_NO_ALARM is used.
			o Also if we are running as pthreads as we are now.
			  the code here gets called by the alarm handler in the
			  SEH.

dsm_events.c   - Contains code for the DSM mainly to do the normal throttling 
                 and thresholding of events and their rules. 

dsm_init.c     - Contains initialization code for the DSM. This is responsible
                 for calling all the sub-modules initialization functions.
                 Control passes here only once in a DSM's lifetime to do the
                 initialization. 

dsm_main.c     - Contains code for the main loop of the DSM thread/process.
                 Control stays here for the rest of the life of the DSM -- i.e.,
                 after initialization.
