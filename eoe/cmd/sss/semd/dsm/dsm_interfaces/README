This directory contains code involved for the DSM to interface and interact
with the SEH and SSDB modules.

dsm_seh.c      - DSM to SEH interface. Hides the underlying transport layer
                 to receive the data from the SEH.
dsm_ssdb.c     - DSM to SSDB interface. Anything that involves directly
                 dealing with the SSDB should be here.
