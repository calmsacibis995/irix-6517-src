1) Didn't port IPATH - search path for include files
2) Didn't port DPATH - search path for dependencies - both
	were undocumented MIPS extensions
3) copys - hash in ATT is cast to unsigned char - old MIPS did not.
	did not pick up.
4) MIPS stuff (ver 1.1) differed from SVR3 in the afilescan routine -
	ATT (R3 & R4) looks for name match and the following char to
	be either a / or NULL or space - MIPS just looked for a name match.
	Left it to be ATT style.
5) in MIPS the entryscan leaves the symbol as the entry point - in 3.2 and
	4.0 the entry scan overwrites symbol with the member name
	Left as ATT

6) MIPS added MAKEARGS variable - we have left it out. No BSD or ATT things
	has it ...

7) the lib((entry)) doesn't work - nor did it in 4.0

8) old VPATH currently was not ported

9) ifdefed out new VPATH stuff and -v -o option using VIEWPATH - ATT
	didn't document it.
