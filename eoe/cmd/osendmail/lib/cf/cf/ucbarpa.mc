#  This machine has been decommissioned at Berkeley, and hence should
#  not be considered to be tested.  This file is provided as an example
#  only, of how you might set up a joint SMTP/UUCP configuration.  At
#  this point I recommend using `FEATURE(mailertable)' instead of
#  `SITECONFIG'.  See also ucbvax.mc.
