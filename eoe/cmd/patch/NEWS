#ident  "$Revision: 1.1 $"

Changes in version 2.1:

* A few more portability bugs have been fixed.  The version number has
  been changed from 2.0.12g11 to 2.1, because the name
  `patch-2.0.12g10' was too long for traditional Unix file systems.

Versions 2.0.12g9 through 2.0.12g11 fix various portability bugs.

Changes in version 2.0.12g8:

* Start of the 12g series, with a GNU-style configure script and
  long-named options.
* Added the -t --batch option, similar to -f.
* Improved detection of files that are locked under RCS or SCCS.  
* Reinstate the -E option to remove output files that are empty after
  being patched.
* Print the system error message when system calls fail.
* Fixed various bugs and portability problems.
