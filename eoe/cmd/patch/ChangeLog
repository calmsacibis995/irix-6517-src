Sat Mar 14 13:13:29 1992  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at frob.eng.umd.edu)

	patching, remove it.
	(get_some_switches): Recognize -E option.

	* patch.c (copy_till): Make garbled output an error, not a warning
	that doesn't change the exit status.

	* patchlevel.h: PATCHLEVEL 12u5.

	* Makefile.SH: Change clean, distclean, and realclean targets a
	little so they agree with the GNU coding standards.
	Add Makefile to addedbyconf, so distclean removes it.

	* Configure: Recognize Domain/OS C library in /lib/libc.
	From mmuegel@mot.com (Michael S. Muegel).

	* pch.c: Fixes from Wayne Davison:
	Patch now accepts no-context context diffs that are
	specified with an assumed one line hunk (e.g.  "*** 10 ****").
	Fixed a bug in both context and unified diff processing that would
	put a zero-context hunk in the wrong place (one line too soon).
	Fixed a minor problem with p_max in unified diffs where it would
	set p_max to hunkmax unnecessarily (the only adverse effect was to
	not supply empty lines at eof by assuming they were truncated).

Tue Jul  2 03:25:51 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Configure: Check for signal declaration in
	/usr/include/sys/signal.h as well as /usr/include/signal.h.

	* Configure, common.h, config.h.SH: Comment out the sprintf
	declaration and tests to determine its return value type.  It
	conflicts with ANSI C systems' prototypes in stdio.h and the
	return value of sprintf is never used anyway -- it's always cast
	to void.

	* patchlevel.h: PATCHLEVEL 12u3.

	* patch.c (nextarg): New function.
	(get_some_switches): Use it, to prevent dereferencing a null
	pointer if an option that takes an arg is not given one (is last
	on the command line).  From Paul Eggert.

	* pch.c (another_hunk): Fix from Wayne Davison to recognize
	single-line hunks in unified diffs (with a single line number
	instead of a range).

	* inp.c (rev_in_string): Don't use `s' before defining it.  From
	Wayne Davison.

Mon Jan  7 06:25:11 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at geech.ai.mit.edu)

	* patchlevel.h: PATCHLEVEL 12u2.

	* Configure: When checking for C preprocessor, look for 'abc.*xyz'
	instead of 'abc.xyz', so ANSI C preprocessors work.

	* Apply fix for -D from ksb@mentor.cc.purdue.edu (Kevin Braunsdorf).

	* Apply unidiff patches from davison@dri.com (Wayne Davison).

Wed Mar  7 23:47:25 1990  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon at pogo.ai.mit.edu)

	* patch.c (reverse_flag_specified): New variable.
