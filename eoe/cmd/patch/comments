#ident  "$Revision: 1.1 $"

1. -b. (test 6, 7, 8, 10)
In gnu patch, -b requires an argument as the suffix we want for the backup
file. In xpg4 spec, -b doesn't have an argument and when it's specified,
we add suffix ".orig" after the original filename. What do we do?

3. Environment variable: SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX. Should we use it or not?

4. For test 21, if we have the format:

Index file1.txt
....
....
Index file1.txt


How do we apply the patch? Do we apply the second patch on the original
file1.txt or the one after the first patch? Do we replace the first patch
result with the second patch or append second patch on the first one?

5. -p (test 22, 23, 24, 35, 36)
For test 22, -p in gnu takes optional argument, so the argument has
to be after -p immediately. In order to pass 22, we have to force
required argument. 

6. exit status(41)
If we have reject file, then we set the status 1 no matter how many
hunks we failed.
