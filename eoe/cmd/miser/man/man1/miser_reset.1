.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I miser_reset
command is used to force a running version of miser to use
a new configuration file (the format of the configuration file
is detailed in 
.I miser(4)
).  The new configuration will succeed if and only if all
currently scheduled jobs can be successfully scheduled against
the new configuration.  If the attempt at creating a new
configuration fails, then 
.I miser(1)
retains the old configuration.
.P
The 
.I miser_reset 
will fail if the requested new 
.I miser 
configuration oversubscribes the resources that are currently 
available to 
.I miser.  
The maximum system resources, memory and the number of CPUs, 
that are available to 
.I miser, 
are specified at miser's initial startup by arguments to command 
line options.
