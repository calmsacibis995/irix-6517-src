<h1>notes on oview_layout</h1>

<h2>algorithms</h2>

<p> the basic strategy is:
<br>while (unbound routers) 
 <ul>
<li> pick the most-connected router (top_router())
<li> put it in the best place (top/new/choose_vertex())
</ul>
 ie, oview_layout currently makes two kinds of decisions
 <ul>
<li> which router to place next
<li> where to place the router
</ul>
 both of these stages need some work.

<p> the choice of the next router to place (top_router) may need a
little tweaking, but the main problem lies in the area of placement.

<h3>large number of routers</h3>

<p> oview_layout doesn't cope well with large numbers of routers.
 there seem to be two interrelated factors here:
<ul>
<li> the topology is no longer homogeneous (meta-routers vs routers)
<li> decisions need to take into account non-local topology
</ul>

<h3>most connected router</h3>

<p>the most-connected router is currently chosen on the basis of
<ul>
<li>number of direct links to bound routers
<li>number of 1-distant links to bound routers
<li>total number of links to this router
<li>whether or not it has nodes
</ul>

<h3>best point</h3>

<h4>old vert</h4>

<p> OLD_VERT has a fixed set of verticies, and tries seeding the
algorithm with the top_router() bound to each vertex in turn.  the
least-cost solution is then used.  OLD_VERT maintains information
about its fixed set of verticies and their relationships with each
other, which is used in deciding which vertex to bind to next
(top_vertex()). 

<p>OLD_VERT is ok for small numbers of routers, but:
<ul>
 <li>it is easy to be forced into bad corners, which is why we need to
cycle at least the first router through all possible starting
positions, and even this is not enough in some situations.
 <li>larger configurations with more variable and complex
possibilities just don't lend themselves to this set-position approach
</ul>

<h4>new vert</h4>

<p> the NEW_VERT algorithm (new_vertex()) creates a vertex whenever it
is needed.  it looks at all verticies 1-distant from those already
used, evaluates the cost of placing the top_router there (eval_pos()),
and chooses the cheapest.  a free vertex 1-distant from more than one
router will be evaluated more than once (BUG).

<p>NEW_VERT is ok for small numbers of routers, but:
<ul>
 <li>equal-cost vertex placements may force us into bad corners, and
it is hard to determine a heuristic which will allow us to
discriminate between these currently equal-cost decisions
 </ul>

<h4>backtrack</h4>

<p> there are points in NEW_VERT at which one of a number of
equal-cost solutions is chosen essentially at random.  this may happen
in top_router() and in new_vertex().  in top_router(), the equal-cost
choices are essentially equal-cost, however in new_vertex(),
equal-cost placements will have different cost ramifications for
subsequent placements -- our cost function isn't good enough.

<p> the BACKTRACK algorithm (descend() / choose_vertex()) is based on
NEW_VERT, but branches at each vertex placement where there is more
than one equal-cost solution.  it backs out as soon as the cost is
greater than the best-cost so far.  the assumption here (valid?) is
that a better-cost choice at any stage will lead to a better-cost
solution.  if this ain't true, we have to exhaustively search the
solution space.  it does badly enough already: it is O(x^N), where N
is (about) the number of routers, and speed rapidly declines after
about N==10.

<p> BACKTRACK ignores the CLING_COC hint.

<p>BACKTRACK is ok for small numbers of routers, but:
<ul>
 <li>its exponential behaviour probably make it untenable,
 even with far more efficient evaluations, for large numbers of routers
 </ul>

<h4>cost function</h4>

<p> different cost functions (penalise()) can be chosen for
NEW_VERT/BACKTRACK using the -V option, making the addition of
different kinds of links more or less costly.

<p> OLD_VERT uses the config_cost() function, a sum of squares of
distances (ie we don't sqrt() things).

<h4>secondary cost</h4>

<p> a secondary cost function (CLING_COC) invoked in eval_pos() for
NEW_VERT makes the penalty slightly greater for verticies further away
from the "centre of connectedness" -- the average position of all the
bound routers that <em>the unbound routers the router is connected
to</em> are connected to.  this seems to improve choices, but it is
unclear whether it is a uniformly benificial heuristic.  for want of
something better, we use it.

<h3>suggested approach</h3>

<p> the current approach works well for small numbers of routers.  the
suggested approach is to alternate between the placement of routers,
and the placement of meta-routers, and to proceed on a
subset-by-subset basis.  the routers are broken up into local
'networks' interconnected by meta-routers.  each collection of routers
or metarouters tends to be a cube.
 <ul>

<li> we start by placing (non-meta) routers as per NEW_VERT

<li> when there are no more routers connected to those already bound,
we use the placement of the routers to force the placement of the
(cube of) meta-routers. this requires new placement heuristics

<li> once no more meta-routers can be connected, we return to the
placement of routers, however we continue to use the new placement
heuristics, attacking one 'cube' subset of the routers at a time
</ul>

this algorithm essentially partitions our placement problem, making it
tractable.  the issue of missing/inactive (meta/normal) routers may
complicate things, but shouldn't detract from the basic approach.

<h2>representation</h2>

<h3>desirable layout / representation</h3>

<h4>moderately large</h4>

<p>we consider here the 6-metarouter case (with say 128 cpus) (try
oview -c 128ortho2.topology, and oview -c 192ortho2.topology).  the
128 cpu topology seems to be the limit of the current approach -- the
192 cpu layout works spatially (we can do it), but is simply
appallingly cluttered.

<p> given the need for many extended links which will lead to
increased clutter, some minor representational changes should be made,
even if this is only to turn the link tubes into lines... this will
also improve rendering speed.  the intersection of these extended
links should still be avoided, although the 192 cpu layout may force
us to use some.

<p>we are assuming that the basic heuristic currently being used for
layout is still valid for configurations of this size... ie we assume
that the most closely packed layout is the best one.

<h4>truly large</h4>

<p>for truly large numbers of routers (in systems with >6
metarouters), a different representation and layout is almost
certainly needed, possibly allowing drill-down to the current model

<p>some possibilities
 <ul>

<li> sprout the links: (this assumes we're able to draw these
topologies with sensible links in the first place).  unsprouted, we
could use simple lines, or show nothing at all.  showing nothing is
probably not helpful, as we are then left with a mass of points
(routers) in space, with nothing more.

<li>draw each block of 8 routers as a 'cube'

 <ul>
<li> how to arrange these?

<li> how to swap btwn this rep and our lower-level one?
<li> can we use/select subsets? how?

<li> what to modulate in this rep?
<li> how to assign routers to cubes?
<li> if (nrouters%8 != 0) ? how to arrange/represent partial cubes?
</ul>

<li> give up on representing the topology (flat plane a-la pmview)
<li> show only subsets of topology:
 <br> how to select subsets? can we change the subset once within
oview? navigating a 'window' on the topology by selecting 'external'
links, 'edge' routers, the centre router, a radius of connection, ...
</ul>
