These are the tools needed in the PCP build.

We cannot use the binaries built in the sibling directories, as these
may involve other libraries from $ROOT (e.g. libc), and be in a.out
formats that are not supported on the build machine.

The former problem could be overcome with LD_LIBRARY_PATH and related
controls.  The latter problem in unsolvable!

So, we recompile these tools using the local libraries and compilers
on the build machine.
