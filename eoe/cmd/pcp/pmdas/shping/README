Performance Co-Pilot shping PMDA for General Performance Monitoring
===================================================================

This PMDA is designed to be configurable to monitor elapsed time and
CPU time (user and system) for arbitrary applications that can be run
from the Bourne shell.  Each application is assumed to run to completion
to probe or ping a particular service or dimension of system performance.

The metrics exported from the shping PMDA may be used to quantify of
service or service availability for both critical system services and
tasks that well correlated to performance as perceived by end-users.

The sample configuration file includes examples to "ping":

    + sh(1) start up and exit
    + a simple task, date(1)
    + sum(1) for some simple user-mode computation
    + compilation and execution of an antipodean variant of the
      generic "hullo world" C program
    + DNS (default server, trivial and error cases)
    + yp service via ypcat(1)
    + rpcinfo(1) for RPC registration from portmap/rpcbind
    + mail delivery (telnet tcp port 25)
    + Usenet news from nntp (telnet tcp port 119)

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT shping

Installation of the shping PMDA
===============================

 +  # cd /var/pcp/pmdas/shping

 +  Check that there is no clash with the Performance Metrics Domain
    number defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use
    (/etc/pmcd.conf).  If there is, edit ./domain.h and choose another
    domain number.

 +  Then run the Install script (as root)

	# ./Install

    and choose both the "collector" and "monitor" installation
    configuration options.

    Answer the questions, which include the option to specify new or
    alternate commands to be run.  See /var/pcp/pmdas/shping/sample.conf
    for example specifications of commands.

 +  Alternatively, to install just the Performance Metrics Name Space
    for the shping metrics on the local system, but not the shping PMDA
    (presumably because the local system is running PCP 1.x and you
    wish to connect to a remote system where PCP 2.0 and the shping PMDA
    is running), make sure the Performance Metrics Domain defined in
    ./domain.h matches the domain chosed for the shping PMDA on the
    remote system (check the second field in the corresponding line of
    the /etc/pmcd.conf file on the remote system), then

	# ./Install -N

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

	# cd /var/pcp/pmdas/shping
	# ./Remove

Changing the settings
=====================

The cycle time and timeout period can be dynamically modified using
pmstore(1) for the metrics shping.control.cycletime and
shping.control.timeout respectively.

To make permanent changes, re-run the Install script.

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    (/var/adm/pcplog/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    (/var/adm/pcplog/shping.log) should be checked for any warnings or
    errors.

 +  If the Install script reports some warnings when checking the
    metrics, the problem should be listed in one of the log files.

 +  Additional information can be logged if there appears to be
    problems.  The PCP application debug flags will cause the PMDA to
    report additional information in /var/adm/pcplog/shping.log.  For
    details about the agent's debug flags, use the comand

	$ pminfo -T shping.control.debug
