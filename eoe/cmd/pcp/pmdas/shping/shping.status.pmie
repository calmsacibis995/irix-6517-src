not responded within a timeout period (as defined by the PCP metric
shping.control.timeout) during the last sample interval.

If this rule is enabled, the shping PMDA should be installed; see
/var/pcp/pmdas/shping/README and pmdashping(1).

If some application or service is not available then the
corresponding line should be commented out of the shping
