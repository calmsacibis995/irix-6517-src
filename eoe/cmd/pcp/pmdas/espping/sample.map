# Example mapping file for espping PMDA Configure script
# 
# This configuration file is site-specific and is typically generated by
# the System Group Manager (SGM).  The complete set of services is defined
# in /var/pcp/pmdas/espping/template.conf and new services should be added
# in that file before using them here.
# 
# Entries in this file are used to expand the "HOST", and service keywords
# in the template configuration file.  The host LOCAL will be
# replaced with the local host name for monitoring local services.
