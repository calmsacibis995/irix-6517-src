# 'Fix' an USRobotics modem.
#    This script writes a configuration suitable for operation with IRIX
#    into the non-volatile memory in the modem.

#	-i	for inbound use only
#	-o	for outbound use only
#	-io	for both
#	-m model to specify the model number, as in "-m 14.4ex"
#	-v	for verbose debugging
#	-c cmd	to add the string of Hayes-like commands, "cmd",
#		    to the end of string of initializations.
#	-s bps	to specify the DTE speed, either "19200" or "38400"

# This script must be run by "root".

# When this script is run, it sends the responses of the modem to
#	standard out.  It ends by telling the modem to display all
#	of its parameters.  If you do not see the right results,
#	first check the cable to the modem.

# This script uses 'ttyd*' device names, so that it is not stopped by a
#	need for DCD.  Since there is often a getty(1M) running on
#	a 'ttyf*', and since you cannot simultaneously open 'ttyf' and
#	'ttyd', it is necessary to stop the getty in /etc/inittab
#	before using this script.  If a uugetty(1M) is running on the
#	port, it need not be turned off, because this script will
#	temporarily disable it.


# Additional local commands should be added to this file in the following
#	line or provided with the -c option
loc=""


# With a USRobotics Sportster or Courier,
# use a line in /etc/inittab that runs /usr/lib/uucp/uugetty with arguments
# such as the following:
#	 -Nt60 -iusrin,conn ttyf2 dx_38400
# See `man uugetty` and `man inittab`.
