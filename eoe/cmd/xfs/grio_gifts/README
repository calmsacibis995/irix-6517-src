This directory contains sample programs which use the XFS
guaranteed rate i/o (grio) and realtime file features.

The rtcp program copies a realtime or non-realtime file to the 
realtime partition of an XFS file system. The program will pad the
size of the source file to the correct length so that the destination  
file can be created on the realtime partition.

The grioread program creates a guaranteed rate stream and
associates it with the file. The file is then read and the timing is 
verified. Nothing is done with the contents of the file.
