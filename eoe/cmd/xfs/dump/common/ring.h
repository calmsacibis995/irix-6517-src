/* ring - readahead/writeahead abstraction
 *
 * the ring is conceptually an ordered set of messages circulating between the
 * client thread and the I/O slave thread. a message can be in one of four
 * places: on the ready queue, held by the client, on the active queue, or held
 * by the slave. The client and slave can each hold at most one message at a
 * time. all others must be on one of the two queues. the messages must
 * circulate in that order: ready, client, active, slave, ready, ...
 * initially all messages are on the ready queue, with status set to
 * INIT. The client uses ring_get to remove a message from the ready queue.
 * the client can then use the message to read or write. to read, the client
 * sets the op field to READ, and places the message on the active queue. the
 * slave will remove messages from the active queue, invoke the client-supplied
 * read function with the message's buffer, record the read function's return
 * value in the message, set the message status to OK (read function returned 0)
 * or ERROR (read returned non-zero), and place the message on the ready queue.
 * the client will see the message after removing all messages ahead of it on
 * the ready queue. to write, the client follows almost the same procedure,
 * except the client fills the buffer and sets the op to WRITE prior to placing
 * the message on the active queue.
 *
 * if the client-supplied read or write function returns an error, the slave
 * will set the message status to ERROR. the slave will pass all subsequent
 * messages appearing on the active queue directly to the ready queue with
 * no I/O done and the message status set to IGNORE. the slave will remain
 * in this state until a reset is performed (see below).
 *
 * The client may at anytime place a NOP msg on the ring. the slave does
 * nothing with this mmessage other than to place it back on the ready queue
 * with NOPACK status. This is useful for inhibiting read-ahead.
 *
 * To flush the ring, the client must repetatively place TRACE messages on the
 * active queue until it sees an IGNORE msg on the ready queue. the slave will
 * simply transfer TRACErs from active to ready with no other action taken
 * (other than to set the message status to IGNORE).
 *
 * the client may at any time reset the ring. the reset will return to the
 * client when the current I/O being executed by the slave completes, and
 * all messages have been wiped clean and placed on the ready queue with
 * status set to INIT. the ring_reset function accomplishes this internally by
 * placing a RESET message on the active QUEUE, and continuing to remove
 * messages from the ready queue (without placing them on the active queue)
 * until the RESET message is seen the slave responds to a reset message by
 * setting the status to RESETACK, queueing the message on the ready queue, and
 * waiting for a message from the active queue. ring_reset will then re-
 * initialize the ring and return. note that the client may be holding one
 * message at the time the reset is called. if so, it must pass a pointer to
 * that message into the reset call. otherwise it must pass in NULL.
 *
 * the ring_destroy function may be invoked to shut down the ring and kill the
 * slave thread. it simply places a DIE message on the active queue, and waits
 * for a DIEACK response. it then de-allocates all semaphores memory allocated
 * by ring_create.
 *
 * the message structure includes a 64 bit field for the convenience
 * of the client. it is not perturbed during any ring operations.
 *
 * the ring maintains four performance metering values: the number of times
 * the slave and client attempted to get a message, and the number of times
 * those attempts resulting in blocking.
