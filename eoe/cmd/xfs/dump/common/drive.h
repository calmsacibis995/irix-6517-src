/* drive.[hc] - drive abstraction
 *
 * drive_t provides a framework for device-independent drive abstraction,
 * as well as initialization of appropriate drive handlers.
 *
 * A drive_t is a drive manager providing capabilities for reading, writing,
 * and manipulating media objects (e.g., tape cartridges).
 *
 * All writing and reading is done within the scope of a media file. Writes
 * may be cut short due to media events (e.g., EOM). The mark
 * mechanism allows the caller to determine what portion of the write data
 * stream is guaranteed to have been committed to media.
 *
 * Marks may be placed in the stream during writes. During subsequent
 * reads of the data stream, the media object may be positioned at a
 * specific mark, or to the next mark in the stream.
 *
 * To accomodate end-of-media uncertainty, the marks are set in two steps.
 * First the caller asks to set a mark at a position within the write stream,
 * providing a callback function. The callback will be invoked when the data
 * prior to that mark has been committed to media.
 *
 * The caller must re-position the media (e.g., change media objects or
 * begin a new media file) and re-write any portion of the data written
 * after the last committed mark. It is entirely possible for part of that
 * data to have made it onto the previous media file, due to the uncertainty
 * of end-of-media handling of some drives. Thus the caller must be prepared
 * for portions of data read from the end of one media file to be duplicated
 * at the beginning of the next media file.
 *
 * To allow repositioning the stream in the above scenarios,
 * drive_t supplies forward-space-file, backward-space-file, rewind,
 * seek_mark, and get_mark operators.
 *
 * A call to the end_read or end_write operator virtually positions the
 * media at the beginning of the next media file. Thus if a caller calls
 * begin read, looks at the header and decides to overwrite the media
 * file, a call to the bsf operator must be made prior to the call to
 * begin_write. However, if the media is positioned at EOD and the caller calls
 * begin_read, EOD will be returned and no repositioning is needed. A call
 * to begin_write will append a new media file after the last media file.
 *
 * Drive_init1 selects and instantiates a drive manager for each drive
 * identified on the command line. This is done by showing the drive
 * successively to each drive strategy module. The drive strategies
 * supply a match score. The strategy with the highest score gets to
 * instantiate a drive manager for that drive.
 *
 * Drive_init2 allocates and initializes read and write header buffers for
 * each drive, and calls each drive manager's init operator, which begins async
 * initialization of the drive. This includes determining if a media object
 * is currently mounted in that drive.
 *
 * Drive_init3 synchronizes with the async initializations kicked off by
 * drive_init2.
 *
 * Each drive strategy is defined by a drive_strategy_t. This supplies
 * a match function, and an instantiate function.
 *
 * The match function lets the given strategy determine if it is the correct
 * strategy to choose. The instantiate function creates a driver manager.
 *
 * The I/O write model presents the user with a function to get a write buffer,
 * or get a page-aligned write buffer, and a function to take back the buffer
 * and commit part or all of that buffer to media. The read model is similar;
 * the caller may ask for a buffer filled with read data, and gives the buffer
 * back after the data is used. These models facilitate high-performance
 * operation, since the buffers can be used in direct I/O.
 */

/* drive_hdr_t - drive media file header
 *
 * A drive media file header is imbedded in the global media file header
 * structure, which is in turn placed at the beginning of each media file. The
 * drive hdr has three parts: generally useful drive-related info, info
 * specific to the selected drive strategy, and upper layer info. Each drive
 * handler contains two drive header images; a read hdr and a write hdr.
 *
 * CAUTION! the various components of the media file header are carefully
 * crafted to fit in DRIVE_HDR_SZ bytes.
