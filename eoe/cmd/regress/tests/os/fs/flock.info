------
This test makes sure that a non-intuitive file locking corner case works.
Specifically, locking with start address == 0x7fffffff and lengh == 1,
which would appear to wrap, but works on most systems (local and nfs).

The test opens itself (O_RDONLY), and performs the file locking on itself.
Tests nfs if run remotely.
