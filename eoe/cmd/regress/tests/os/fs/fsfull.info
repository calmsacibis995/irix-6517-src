fsfull
------
This test makes sure that a process which fills up a file system actually
gets the last bytes of the FS.  Does so by writing until the file system
reports full, truncating a small number of bytes, tries to write a
larger number of bytes, and tests that it can only write the small number.

Yes, this was actually a problem as a user site.
