On XFS fs, create many files (0 size) to use up all inodes.  This used to
cause panics and/or assertions because of bugs in how ag is allocated.

For the curious, we try to create 67108864 files :-).  It may actually
work on a large enough XFS fs.  At least with large enough fs, it may
take a long time before running out of inodes.  It is recommended that
this test be run on a "small" XFS fs.
