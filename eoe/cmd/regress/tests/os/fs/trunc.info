trunc
------
This test forks, and each process creates temp file, writes patterns to
various locations in the file, and truncates it to random sizes,
all the while checking that the data is (are?) correct.

The test forks so that there is a greater chance that the data files
will get fragmented and will expose any file fragmentation bugs.
