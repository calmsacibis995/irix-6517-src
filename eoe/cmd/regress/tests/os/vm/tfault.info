tfault
------

This is a test program for using multireader region locks in tfault.
It creates mappings in 8 segments, then forks multiple processes
which touch a page in each segment.  To prevent the system from
going into segment mode and by passing the tfault code, each process
using mprotect to alter its address space after going through all
8 segments.  This causes the wired entries to be flushed and ensures
that every reference takes a full tfault.
