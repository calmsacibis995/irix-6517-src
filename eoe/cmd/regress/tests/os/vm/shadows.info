shadows
-------

This is a unit test for sproc processes with overlapping shared and
private regions (called shadows).  The parent creates a number of
shared mappings, initializes the pages with generation numbers,
and then starts up an sproc share group.  The sproc children then
map local regions and test the memory to make sure they get the
correct pages in each case.  (Each process uses unique generation
numbers in its pages.)  When it's all over, the parent re-checks
the shared mappings to make sure they haven't changed.
