This is a unit test for mapped files that are grown after the mapping
is made.  At each step of the way, it verifies that the portion of the
mapping which is included in the file size is actually accessible, and
that the portion beyond EOF causes SIGBUS to be delivered.  It then
grows the file incrementally and re-tests the memory.  It also tries
truncating the file and then re-filling it.
