This is a unit test program to ensure instruction cache consistency for
the case of self-modifying code.  It copies code into its data area and
executes it.  It uses the mprotect system call to do all the necessary
cache flushing.  When run on an MP system, this program checks the
caches on each processor to ensure all are consistent.
