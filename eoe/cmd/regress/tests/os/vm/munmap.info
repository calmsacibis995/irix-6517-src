munmap
------

This is a unit test program that does a variety of different
things with munmap.  Among the things it tests are:

- checking some error cases
- maps a block of memory, then munmaps it one page at time in
  various orders such as:
	low addresses to high
	high addresses to low
	from the middle outward
	random unmappings
- tries unmapping groups of regions, some with holes between them
- tries some cases with both shared and private regions

The tests verify that unmapped memory is inaccessible and that
the proper signal is delivered.  It also tests to ensure that
other mapped memory is not affected by an munmap.

When run with the -v option, it prints a message about each
test it tries.
