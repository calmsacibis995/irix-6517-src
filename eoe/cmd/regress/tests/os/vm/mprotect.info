mprotect
--------

This is a unit test program for the mprotect system call.  It tests
various error cases to ensure the proper error code is returned.  It
then alters the page protections on a region of memory and ensures that
only the allowable access can be done, and that the proper signals are
delivered when invalid accesses are attempted.
