segreserve
-----

This is a simple test used to drive the pmap layer segment reservation
handler.

The test finds a large chunk of contiguous user vitual space via
optimistic, non-fixed mmap calls, then makes many fixed-address mmap(2)
and munmap(2) calls on randomly-sized and randomly-spaces within this
region of address space.

If the segment reservation handler works correctly, the system will
not have avail[rs]mem depletion.
