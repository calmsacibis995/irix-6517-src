This is a unit test for mmap() ~ /proc bug.
Typically, this  bug allows any readable file writable when used with dbx.

In this program, a parent process, P, with root privileges creates
a tmp file, T, with read permission for others.  Then P forks C,
which on fork will have root privileges. C then becomes a 'normal'
process through set[u,g]id. By default "guest" account is used as
a normal user. Then, C mmaps T at address A (for which as normal user it
has only read permission). C opens itself through /proc and writes() 
at address A: If there is a bug, then this write has to fail.

After forking, P waits for C, cleans up the tmpfile,
and returns C's exit status.
