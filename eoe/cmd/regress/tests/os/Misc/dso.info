This is an unit test for interaction between dso's and mmap.
Particularly it tests for the case when a dso's load address
clashes with a region at which an mmaped region exists: under
such situations the kernel (elf loader) is responsible for choosing
a suitable address for relocating the dso.
Tests cases where only text (of dso) overlaps with the mmaped region,
and also when data overlaps with the region.

By default x.so and y.so are used as the dso's.
Each contains a single trivial function which prints a mesaage.

Messages are printed only if -v option is supplied.

Exit status 0 if successful, non-zero otherwise.
