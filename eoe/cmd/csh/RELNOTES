1. Should turn on compile time option -DMBCHAR if we can find the following 
   three functions:

	wcsetno()
	csetcol()
	euclen()

2. The following files are removed since they are used as BSD wrappers.
   Instead, the compile time option -D_BSD_COMPAT is turned on in Makefile.

	bcopy.c		bzero.c		gethostname.c
	getpagesize.c	getrusage.c	getwd.c
	index.c		killpg.c	rindex.c
	setjmp.c	setpgrp.c	setpriority.c
	sh.sig.c 	signal.c 	stubs.c
	wait3.c 	dir2.h o	wait.h
	param.h 	resource.h 	setjmp.h
	signal.h 	vfork.h
	
3. compat.c and sgi_init.h are added by SGI.

4. Internationalized by frank@ceres.esd.sgi.com
	- multibyte character support
	- VFORK not longer supported by IRIX, removed
	- read_ (wchar_t) made faster
	- 'set path = ( $path ..... )' is now possible
	- mbchar for variables, args, aliases, path, user name, history, ...
