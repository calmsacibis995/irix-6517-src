This directory contains the Bison parser generator.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

It was once true that, when installing Bison on Sequent (or Pyramid?)
systems, you had to be in the Berkeley universe.  This may no longer
be true; we have no way to tell.

On VMS, you will probably have to create Makefile from Makefile.in by
hand.  Remember to do `SET COMMAND BISON' to install the data in
`BISON.CLD'.

Send bug reports to bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.  Please include the
version number from `bison --version', and a complete, self-contained
test case in each bug report.
