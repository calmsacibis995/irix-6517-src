Please don't remove this file /.varupdate.

This file is a marker used by the miniroot "mrreorgrc" script to
identify file systems which have been reorganized from the IRIX 4
(and before) file system layout to the IRIX 5 layout.

This one time reorganization moves the /usr subdirectories:

    spool adm mail preserve tmp lib/inst lib/rfindd

to /var, where /var will be a symlink to /usr/var in the case
that this system has a separately mounted /usr file system.

Removing this file /.varupdate will increase slightly the risk
that the "mrreorgrc" (formerly part of the instdriver script)
which runs automatically each time the miniroot is loaded to
use inst, will inadvertently try to move a major /usr or
/var subdirectory again.

(The contents of this file, the above text, don't matter.
 All that matters is the presence or absence of the file.)
