#
# Generic /etc/project file
#
# This file contains a list of users and the projects that they are
# permitted to join (e.g. with the "newproj" command). The format of an
# entry is:
#
# loginname:projectname,projectname,...
#
# where "loginname" is the user's normal login name as specified in
# /etc/passwd, and "projectname" is a standard project name as specified
# in /etc/projid. The first project name in the list is considered to be
# the user's "default" project and will be assigned to the user's session
# upon initial login.
#
# Comments (introduced by "#") and blank lines are ignored. White space
# is *NOT* ignored within a record and should be carefully avoided.
#
# Examples:
# root:sysadm,genuser,batchuser
# rob:genuser
