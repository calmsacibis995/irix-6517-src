			SATMPD OPTIONS

	satmpd [-c configdir] [-d STARTUP,FILE_OPEN,DIR_OPEN,OPEN_FAIL,OPENDIR_FAIL,PROTOCOL,ALL] [-p port] -v

	-c <configdir>
		Set the location of satmpd configuration files to <configdir>
	-d <debug-options>
		Turn on the requested debugging option
	-l <logfile>
		Direct logging output to <logfile>
	-p <port>
		Force satmpd to listen on alternate port <port>.

		SATMP CONFIG FILE FORMATS

ATTRIDS
	Human-readable names of the SATMP attributes plus their numerical
	values. ATTRIDS has the following format:

	<ATTRIBUTE>:<NUMBER>, one per line.

	Example:
		SEN_LABEL:0
		NATIONAL_CAVEATS:1
		INTEGRITY_LABEL:2
		INFO_LABEL:3
		PRIVILEGES:4
		AUDIT_ID:5
		IDS:6
		CLEARANCE:7
		AUDIT_INFO:8
		UNASSIGNED_9:9
		ACL:10
		UNASSIGNED_11:11

	It is an unrecoverable error if "ATTRIDS" is missing.

The following attributes aren't supported:
	NATIONAL_CAVEATS
	INFO_LABEL
	AUDIT_INFO
	ACL
	UNASSIGNED_9
	UNASSIGNED_11

REQATTR
	Human-readable names of the attributes all clients must support. These
	names must match those in ATTRIDS.

	Example:
		SEN_LABEL
		PRIVILEGES
		ACL

	It is an unrecoverable error if "REQATTR" is missing.

WEIGHTS
	File containing information regarding weights assigned to
	domains-of-interpretation. Weights should be listed in
	descending order within the file.

	<ATTRIBUTE>:<DOMAIN>:<WEIGHT>, one per line

	Example:
		ACL:SGI:255
		ACL:DECMLS:250
		ACL:SUN:245

	It is an unrecoverable error if "WEIGHTS" is missing.


localmap
remotemap
	Files containing attribute mapping information. "localmap" is the
	remote-to-local map, "remotemap" is the local-to-remote map.
	Both files have the following format:

	<ATTRIBUTE>:<DOMAIN>:<SOURCE>:<DEST>, one per line

	The meaning of <src> and <dest> is attribute specific. If the map
	in any domain has a <SOURCE> field with the value "NATIVE_MAPPING",
	the map is ignored and SGI native mapping is assumed. It is an
	unrecoverable error if "localmap" or "remotemap" is missing.

PRIVILEGES
	remote
		<src> is an SGI format capability set. Only the effective
		capabilities are examined, so only specify those :-) Multiple
		capabilities may be specified; a many-to-one mapping is
		possible.

		<dest> is the remote representation of <src>

			CAP_MAC_READ+e:mac-read
			CAP_MAC_WRITE+e:mac-write
			all+eip:all-privs
			CAP_CHOWN,CAP_KILL+e:wacky-priv

	local
		<src> is the remote representation, as one "word". The
		remote representation of the privilege set is broken up
		into words, which are then matched against <src>.

		<dest> is an SGI format capability set. Again, only the
		effective set matters, and a one-to-many mapping is possible.

			mac-read:CAP_MAC_READ+e
			mac-write:CAP_MAC_WRITE+e
			all-privs:all+eip
			wacky-priv:CAP_CHOWN,CAP_KILL+e

AUDIT_ID
	remote
		<local-username>:<remote-username>

			glowell:gary
			casey:schaufler

	local
		<remote-username>:<local-username>

			gary:glowell
			schaufler:casey

IDS
	remote
		user,<local-username>:<remote-username>
		group,<local-groupname>:<remote-groupname>

			user,glowell:gary
			group,wheel:square

	local
		user,<remote-username>:<local-username>
		group,<remote-groupname>:<local-groupname>

SEN_LABEL
INTEGRITY_LABEL
CLEARANCE
	remote
		type,<local-type>:<remote-label-rep>
		level,<local-levelname>:<remote-levelname>
		category,<local-category>:<remote-category>

		If the local label is not a TCSEC label, then it is
		matched against entries of type "type", and <remote-label-rep>
		is the complete remote representation of that label.

		If the local label is a TCSEC label, its local representation
		is always (msentcsec|mintbiba),level[,categories]. The level
		portion is matched against entries of type "level". Each
		category is matched against entries of type "category".

	local
		type,<remote-label-rep>:<local-labeltype>
		level,<remote-levelname>:<local-levelname>
		category,<remote-categoryname>:<local-categoryname>

		First the <remote-label-representation> is compared to
		entries of type "type". If it matches in toto, it is not a
		TCSEC label and <local-labeltype> is the complete local
		representation of that label.

		Otherwise, it has a type of msentcsec or mintbiba, depending
		on whether we are talking about SENSITIVITY/CLEARANCE or
		INTEGRITY. The remote representation is broken into words.
		The largest subsequence of words is matched against entries
		of type "level". If no subsequence matches (in other words,
		even the first word of the label has no match) it is rejected.
		Any remaining words are matched one at a time against entries
		of type "category".
