When using the -v flag, bru adds the current volume
number to each verbosity message.  This is most useful
for later reference to determine which volume of a 
multi-volume set that a given file starts on.

Note that because the output is buffered, and because
the volume number is that of the last successful write,
the indicated volume number may be one less than the 
actual volume when a file is processed near the end
of a volume during creation of an archive.

However, when reading an archive, the volume numbers
are always correct because the read occurs before the
verbosity message is created.  Thus log files created
with a second pass over the archive, with either the
inspect mode (-i) or differences mode (-d), will always
have the correct volume numbers for all files.

The moral is, if you can live with an occasional misleading
volume numbers near volume boundries, the the output from
archive creation will be satisfactory.  Otherwise, create the
log file during a second pass over the archive with either
the inspect mode (fastest) or the differences mode (somewhat
slower but more secure).
