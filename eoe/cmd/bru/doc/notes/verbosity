vflag > 0  (-v, -vv, -vvv, -vvvv, ...):

	(1)	Gives a verbosity message for each file processed in
		all modes except -t, where a table of contents is
		generated instead.

	(2)	Gives differences in verbose mode for -d mode.

	(3)	Gives long listing (ala ls -l) for -t mode.
	

vflag > 1  (-vv, -vvv, -vvvv, ...):

	(1)	Gives buffer size and media size for all modes.

	(2)	For multiply linked files, gives name of file to which
		the current file is linked, for all modes.  If a file is
		a symbolic link, show to what file it points.

	(3)	Gives warning messages about files that are not
		superseded during archive extraction.  Files are 
		superseded when an older file from an archive replaces
		an existing file that has the same date or a new date.
		Normally bru does not supersede files with explicit 
		directive via the -u flag.  This was not tied to verbosity
		level 1 because bru is frequently used to bring an
		existing file hierarchy up to date by "overlaying" it
		with another hierarchy from an archive, replacing 
		out of date files,and adding non-existant files.
		This way, a list of the files actually extracted
		can be obtained without generating a lot of
		spurious warnings about the majority of files,
		which will not be superseded.

	(4)	Echos the user name and uid for selecting files owned
		by a specific user with the -o flag.

	(5)	Echos the modification selection date for selecting
		files newer than a specified date with the -n flag.


vflag > 2  (-vvv, -vvvv, ...):

	(1)	Dumps archive information block for -i flag.


vflag > 3  (-vvvv, ...):

	(1)	Gives execution summary at end of execution.

	(2)	Gives "interrupted ..." or "aborted ..." message
		for reception of SIGINT or SIGQUIT during archive
		creation (-c) or extraction (-x) whenever such
		signals are being caught.
