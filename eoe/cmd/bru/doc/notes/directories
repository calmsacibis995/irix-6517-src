In order to properly restore directories, with their appropriate
access modes, owner, etc, each directory is archived by
writing only the file header block.  The archived directory
size (contents) is set to 0 bytes.

The method used to determine which directories need to be
archived is to build a directory tree in dynamically allocated
memory, from the command line arguments.  Note that the
tree may also have explicitly named non-directory files.
Then, this tree is walked starting at the root node, archiving
each non-directory file as encountered, and recursively archiving
each directory file as encountered.  If a directory file is
also a leaf of the tree, then all files which are children 
of that node also become candidates for archiving.

This method may require a large amount of dynamic memory, particularly
if the list of files to archive is read from the standard input.
This restriction is expected to become less of a problem in the
future, with the emergence of virtual memory and processors with
large address spaces.  Anyone who designs a new UNIX machine with anything
else is foolish.
