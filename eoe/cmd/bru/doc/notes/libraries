Bru makes use of three public domain libraries:

	Dbug:	a macro based C debugging package
	Rmt:	a remote magnetic tape access package
	Ndir:	a directory interface library
	
Only the ndir, directory interface library, is required.  The other two
are optional.

Several bru customers have expressed displeasure with respect to the
installation procedures for the libraries.  In particular, the addition
of various header files to the /usr/include directory, has been the
major complaint.  Some sites have very stringent rules on what can or
can not be added to standard "system areas".  I tend to agree that
cluttering the standard directories with locally installed files
is somewhat distasteful, and tends to become a management nightmare
if carried to excess.

For this reason, the three libraries included with the bru distribution
have been modified to have their header files installed in a local
subdirectory under /usr/include.  I.E.

	/usr/include/dbug.h	=>	/usr/include/local/dbug.h
	/usr/include/dir.h	=>	/usr/include/local/dir.h
	/usr/include/rmt.h	=>	/usr/include/local/rmt.h
	
This has the additional advantage of reducing the possibility of
conflict with future extensions to Unix which might require additional
header files in the standard include directory.  It also makes it
obvious in the source code, via "include <local/whatever.h>", that
these components are really not part of any standard Unix.

It is unfortunate that a standard was not set years ago that used some
sort of organization like the following:

	/usr/local/include	=>	local include files
	/usr/local/lib		=>	local libraries
	/usr/local/bin		=>	local executables
		.
		.
		.

Then, cpp, ld, etc could have been modified to search these directories
first, for locally modified or locally added files.
Sigh.
