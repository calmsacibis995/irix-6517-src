Handling missing:
	see the idbdelete man page


Handling extra
	1) remove all symval, mach, exitop, postop, preop, config
		be careful when removing them (using /symval(.*)/ may
		remove too much - use the following:
		:g/symval([^)]*)/s///
	2) leave in nostrip and any idb tags
	3) remove extra blanks:
		:g/  /s// /g
		Do this a few times until no more matches
		and all trailing balnks:
		:g/ $/s///
	4) sort them as done in the idb file
	5) add appropriate IDB tags
	6) merge into idb
