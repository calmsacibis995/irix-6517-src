.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4flushbus\f1 performs the necessary actions to ensure that any writes in the write buffer have actually been flushed to the system bus. This is sometimes necessary when a device requires delays between PIOs, particularly between a write and a read, since they might otherwise arrive at the device back-to-back.
