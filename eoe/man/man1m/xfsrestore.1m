.SH DESCRIPTION
.I xfsrestore
restores filesystems from dumps produced by \f2xfsdump\f1(1M).
Two modes of operation are available:
simple and cumulative.
.P
The default is simple mode.
.I xfsrestore
populates the specified destination directory, \f2destination\f1,
with the files contained in the dump media.
.P
The
.B \-r
option specifies the cumulative mode.
Successive invocations of
.I xfsrestore
are used to apply a chronologically
ordered sequence of delta dumps to a base (level 0) dump.
The contents of the filesystem at the time each dump was produced
is reproduced.
This can involve adding, deleting, renaming, linking, and
unlinking files and directories.
.P
A delta dump is defined as either an incremental dump
(\f2xfsdump\f1
.B \-l
option with level > 0)
or a resumed dump
(\f2xfsdump\f1
.B \-R
option).
The deltas must be applied in the order they were produced.
Each delta applied must have been produced with the previously applied
delta as its base.
.TP 5
\f3\-a\f1 \f2housekeeping\f1
Each invocation of \f2xfsrestore\f1
creates a directory called
.IR xfsrestorehousekeepingdir .
This directory is normally created
directly under the \f2destination\f1 directory.
The
.B \-a
option allows the operator to specify an alternate directory,
\f2housekeeping\f1,
in which
.I xfsrestore
creates the
.I xfsrestorehousekeeping
directory.
When performing a cumulative (\f3\-r\f1 option) restore,
each successive invocation of \f2xfsrestore\f1 must specify the same alternate
directory.
.TP 5
\f3\-b\f1 \f2blocksize\f1
Specifies the blocksize to be used for the restore. This option is
specified only with the minimal rmt option (see the
.B \-m
option below). For a QIC drive , blocksize must always be 512.
For other drives such as DAT or 8 mm , the same blocksize used for the
xfsdump operation must be specified to restore the tape.
When specified , this blocksize applies to all remote tape sources.
.TP 5
\f3\-c\f1 \f2media_change_alert_program\f1
Use the specified program to alert the operator when a media change is
required. The alert program is typically a script to send a mail or
flash a window to draw the operator's attention.
.TP 5
\f3\-e\f1
Prevents
.I xfsrestore
from overwriting existing files in the \f2destination\f1 directory.
.TP 5
\f3\-f\f1 \f2source\f1
Specifies a source of the dump to be restored.
This can be the pathname of a device (such as a tape drive),
a regular file,
or a remote tape drive (see \f2rmt\f1(1M)).
Up to 20 sources can be specified.
All sources are simultaneously applied to the restore.
For example, if the dump to be restored spanned three tapes,
three tape drives
could be used to simultaneously restore the portions of
the dump contained on each tape.
All other permutations
are supported.
This option must be omitted if the standard input option
(a lone
.B \-
preceding the \f2destination\f1 specification)
is specified.
.TP 5
.B \-i
Selects interactive operation.
Once the on-media directory hierarchy has been read, an
interactive dialogue is begun.
The operator uses a small set of commands to peruse the
directory hierarchy, selecting files and subtrees for extraction.
The available commands are given below.
Initially nothing is selected,
except for those subtrees specified with \f3\-s\f1 command line options.
.RS
.TP 15
\f3ls\f1 [\f2arg\f1]
List the entries in the current directory or the specified directory,
or the specified non-directory file entry.
Both the entry's original inode number and name are displayed.
Entries that are directories are appended with a `/'.
Entries that have been selected for extraction are prepended with a `*'.
.TP
\f3cd\f1 [\f2arg\f1]
Change the current working directory to the specified argument, or to the
filesystem root directory if no argument is specified.
.TP
\f3pwd\f1
Print the pathname of the current directory, relative to the filesystem root.
.TP
\f3add\f1 [\f2arg\f1]
The current directory
or specified file or directory within the current directory
is selected for extraction.
If a directory is specified, then it and all its descendents are
selected.
Entries that are selected for extraction are prepended with a `*'
when they are listed by
.BR ls .
.TP
\f3delete\f1 [\f2arg\f1]
The current directory
or specified file or directory within the current directory
is deselected for extraction.
If a directory is specified, then it and all its descendents are
deselected.
The most expedient way to extract most of the files from a directory
is to select the directory and then deselect
those files that are not needed.
.TP
\f3extract\f1
Ends the interactive dialogue, and causes all selected subtrees to be restored.
.TP
\f3quit\f1
.I xfsrestore
ends the interactive dialogue and immediately exits,
even if there are files or subtrees selected for extraction.
.TP
\f3help\f1
List a summary of the available commands.
.RE
.TP 5
.B \-m
Use the minimal rmt protocol for remote tape sources. This is used when the
remote machine is a non-SGI machine. With this option,
.I xfsrestore
uses version 1 rmt protocol for all remote tape drives. 
This option cannot be used without specifying a blocksize to be used (see 
.B \-b
option above). If all rmt sources 
are SGI machines, it is preferable 
.B not 
to specify this option.
.TP 5
\f3\-n\f1 \f2file\f1
Allows
.I xfsrestore
to restore only files newer than \f2file\f1.
The modification time of \f2file\f1
(i.e., as displayed with the \f3ls -l\f1 command)
is compared to the inode modification time
of each file on the source media
(i.e., as displayed with the \f3ls -lc\f1 command).
A file is restored from media only if its inode modification time
is greater than or equal to
the modification time of \f2file\f1.
.TP 5
\f3\-o\f1
Restore file and directory owner/group even if not root.
When run with an effective user id of root,
.I xfsrestore
restores owner and group of each file and directory.
When run with any other effective user id it does not,
unless this option is specified.
.TP 5
\f3\-p\f1 \f2report_interval\f1
Causes progress reports to be printed at intervals of 
\f2report_interval\f1 seconds.
The interval value is approximate, \f2xfsrestore\f1 will
delay progress reports to avoid undue processing overhead.
.TP 5
\f3\-r\f1
Selects the cumulative mode of operation.
.TP 5
\f3\-s\f1 \f2subtree\f1
Specifies a subtree to restore.
Any number of
.B \-s
options are allowed.
The restore is constrained to the union of all subtrees specified.
Each subtree is specified
as a pathname relative to the restore \f2destination\f1.
If a directory is specified, the directory and all files beneath
that directory are restored.
.TP 5
.B \-t
Displays the contents of the dump,
but does not create or modify any files or directories.
It may be desirable to set the verbosity level to \f3silent\f1
when using this option.
.TP 5
\f3\-v\f1 \f2verbosity_level\f1
Specifies the level of detail of the messages displayed during the course
of the restore.
The argument can be \f3silent\f1, \f3verbose\f1, or \f3trace\f1.
The default is \f3verbose\f1.
.TP 5
.B \-A
Do not restore extended file attributes.
If this option is not specified,
extended file attributes are restored.
Note that dumping of extended file attributes is also optional.
.TP 5
.B \-D
Restore DMAPI (Data Management Application Programming Interface)
event settings.
.I xfsdump
backs backs up these settings,
but it is usually not desirable to restore them.
.TP 5
.B \-E
Prevents
.I xfsrestore
from overwriting newer versions of files.
The inode modification time of the on-media file is compared to the
inode modification time of corresponding file in the \f2destination\f1
directory.
The file is restored only if the on-media version is newer than the version
in the \f2destination\f1 directory.
The inode modification time of a file can be displayed with the \f3ls -lc\f1 command.
.TP 5
.B \-F
Inhibit interactive operator prompts.
This option inhibits 
.I xfsrestore
from prompting the operator for verification of the selected dump 
as the restore target and from prompting for any media change.
.TP 5
.B \-I
Causes the \f2xfsdump\f1 inventory to be displayed
(no restore is performed).
Each time \f2xfsdump\f1 is used, an online inventory
in \f2/var/xfsdump/inventory\f1 is updated.
This is used to determine the base for incremental dumps.
It is also useful for manually identifying a dump session to be restored
(see the
.B \-L
and
.B \-S
options).
Suboptions to filter the inventory display are described later.
.TP 5
.B \-J
Inhibits inventory update when on-media session inventory encountered
during restore.
.I xfsrestore
opportunistically updates the online inventory
when it encounters an on-media session inventory,
but only if run with an effective user id of root
and only if this option is not given.
.TP 5
\f3\-L\f1 \f2session_label\f1
Specifies the label
of the dump session to be restored.
The source media is searched for this label.
It is any arbitrary string up to 255 characters long.
The label of the desired dump session can be copied from the inventory display
produced by the
.B \-I
option.
.TP 5
\f3\-O\f1 \f2options_file\f1
Insert the options contained in \f2options_file\f1
into the beginning of the command line.
The options are specified just as they would appear if typed into the
command line.
In addition, newline characters (\\n) can be used as whitespace.
The options are placed before all options actually given
on the command line,
just after the command name.
Only one \f3\-O\f1 option can be used.
Recursive use is ignored.
The destination directory cannot be specified in \f2options_file\f1.
.TP 5
.B \-Q
Force completion of an interrupted restore session.
This option is required to work around one specific pathological scenario.
When restoring a dump session which was interrupted due to an EOM
condition and no online session inventory is available,
.I xfsrestore
cannot know when the restore of that dump session is complete.
The operator is forced to interrupt the restore session.
In that case, if the operator tries to subsequently apply
a resumed dump (using the \f3\-r\f1 option),
.I xfsrestore
refuses to do so.
The operator must tell
.I xfsrestore
to consider the base restore complete
by using this option when applying the resumed dump.
.TP 5
.B \-R
Resume a previously interrupted restore.
.I xfsrestore
can be interrupted at any time by pressing the
terminal interrupt character (see \f2stty\f1(1)).
Use this option to resume the restore.
The
.B \-a
and
.I destination
options must be the same.
.TP 5
\f3\-S\f1 \f2session_id\f1
Specifies the session UUID
of the dump session to be restored.
The source media is searched for this UUID.
The UUID of the desired dump session can be copied from the inventory display
produced by the
.B \-I
option.
.TP 5
.B \-T
Inhibits interactive dialogue timeouts.
.I xfsrestore
prompts the operator for media changes.
This dialogue normally times out if no response is supplied.
This option prevents the timeout.
.TP 5
\f3\-X\f1 \f2subtree\f1
Specifies a subtree to exclude.
This is the converse of the
.B \-s
option.
Any number of
.B \-X
options are allowed.
Each subtree is specified
as a pathname relative to the restore \f2destination\f1.
If a directory is specified, the directory and all files beneath
that directory are excluded.
.TP 5
\f3\-Y\f1 \f2io_ring_length\f1
Specify I/O buffer ring length.
.I xfsrestore
uses a ring of input buffers to achieve maximum throughput
when restoring from tape drives.
The default ring length is 3.
.TP 5
.B \-
A lone
.B \-
causes the standard input to be read
as the source of the dump to be restored.
Standard input
can be a pipe from another utility (such as \f2xfsdump\f1(1M))
or a redirected file.
This option cannot be used with the
.B \-f
option.
The
.B \-
must follow all other options, and precede the \f2destination\f1
specification.
.P
The dumped filesystem is restored into the \f2destination\f1 directory.
There is no default; the \f2destination\f1 must be specified.
.SH NOTES
.SS Cumulative Restoration
A base (level 0) dump and an ordered set of delta dumps can be
sequentially restored,
each on top of the previous,
to reproduce the contents of the original filesystem
at the time the last delta was produced.
The operator invokes
.I xfsrestore
once for each dump.
The
.B \-r
option must be specified.
The \f2destination\f1 directory must be the same for all invocations.
Each invocation leaves a directory named
.I xfsrestorehousekeeping
in the \f2destination\f1 directory
(however, see the
.B \-a
option above).
This directory contains the state information that must be communicated
between invocations.
The operator must remove this directory after the last delta
has been applied.
.P
.I xfsrestore
also generates a directory named
.I orphanage
in the \f2destination\f1 directory.
.I xfsrestore
removes this directory after completing a simple restore.
However, if
.I orphanage
is not empty,
it is not removed.
This can happen if files present on the dump media
are not referenced by any of the restored directories.
The
.I orphanage
has an entry for each such file.
The entry name is the file's original inode number,
a ".",
and the file's generation count modulo 4096
(only the lower 12 bits of the generation count are used).
.P
.I xfsrestore
does not remove the
.I orphanage
after cumulative restores.
Like the
.I xfsrestorehousekeeping
directory,
the operator must remove it after applying all delta dumps.
.SS Media Management
A dump consists of one or more media files
contained on one or more media objects.
A media file contains all or a portion of the filesystem dump.
Large filesystems are broken up into multiple media files
to minimize the impact of media dropouts,
and to accommodate media object boundaries (end-of-media).
.P
A media object is any storage medium:
a tape cartridge,
a remote tape device (see \f2rmt\f1(1M)),
a regular file,
or the standard input
(currently other removable media drives are not supported).
Tape cartridges can contain multiple media files,
which are typically separated by
(in tape parlance)
file marks.
If a dump spans multiple media objects,
the restore must begin with the media object containing the
first media file dumped.
The operator is prompted when the next media object is needed.
.P
Media objects can contain more than one dump.
The operator can select the desired dump
by specifying the dump label
.RB ( \-L
option),
or by specifying the dump UUID
.RB ( \-S
option).
If neither is specified,
\f2xfsrestore\f1 scans the entire media object,
prompting the operator as each dump session is encountered.
.P
The inventory display
.RB ( \-I
option) is useful for
identifying the media objects required.
It is also useful for identifying a dump session.
The session UUID can be copied from the inventory display
to the
\f3\-S\f1 option argument
to unambiguously identify a dump session to be restored.
.P
Dumps placed in regular files or the standard output
do not span multiple media objects,
nor do they contain multiple dumps.
.SS Inventory
Each dump session updates an inventory database in \f2/var/xfsdump/inventory\f1.
This database can be displayed by invoking
.I xfsrestore
with the
.B \-I
option.
The display uses tabbed indentation to present the inventory
hierarchically.
The first level is filesystem.
The second level is session.
The third level is media stream (currently only one stream is supported).
The fourth level lists the media files sequentially composing the stream.
.P
The following suboptions are available to filter the display.
.TP5
\f3\-I depth=\f1\f2n\f1
(where
.I n
is 1, 2, or 3) limits the hierarchical depth of the display. When
.I n
is 1, only the filesystem information from the inventory is displayed. When
.I n
is 2, only filesystem and session information are displayed. When
.I n
is 3, only filesystem, session and stream information are displayed.
.TP5
\f3\-I level=\f1\f2n\f1
(where
.I n
is the dump level) limits the display to dumps of that particular dump level.
.P
The display may be restricted to media files contained in a specific
media object.
.TP5
\f3\-I mobjid=\f1\f2value\f1
(where
.I value
is a media ID) specifies the media object by its media ID.
.TP5
\f3\-I mobjlabel=\f1\f2value\f1
(where
.I value
is a media label) specifies the media object by its media label.
.P
Similarly, the display can be restricted to a specific filesystem.
.TP5
\f3\-I mnt=\f1\f2host-qualified_mount_point_pathname\f1
(that is, hostname:pathname), identifies the filesystem by mountpoint.
.TP5
\f3\-I fsid=\f1\f2filesystem_id\f1
identifies the filesystem by filesystem ID.
.TP5
\f3\-I dev=\f1\f2host-qualified_device_pathname\f1
(that is, hostname:device_pathname) identifies the filesystem by device.
.P
More than one of these suboptions, separated by commas, may be specified
at the same time to limit the display of the inventory to
those dumps of interest.
However, at most four suboptions can be specified at once:
one to constrain the display hierarchy depth,
one to constrain the dump level,
one to constrain the media object,
and one to constrain the filesystem.
.P
For example,
.B \-I depth=1,mobjlabel="tape 1",mnt=host1:/test_mnt
would display only the filesystem information (depth=1) for
those filesystems that were mounted on \f2host1:/test_mnt\f1
at the time of the dump,
and only those filesystems dumped to the media object labeled "tape 1".
.P
Dump records may be removed (pruned) from the inventory using the
.I xfsinvutil
program.
.P
An additional media file is placed
at the end of each dump stream.
This media file contains the inventory information for the
current dump session.
This is currently unused.
.SS Media Errors
\f2xfsdump\f1 is tolerant of media errors,
but cannot do error correction.
If a media error occurs in the body of a media file,
the filesystem file represented at that point is
lost.
The bad portion of the media is skipped,
and the restoration resumes at the next filesystem file
after the bad portion of the media.
.P
If a media error occurs in the beginning of the
media file,
the entire media file is lost.
For this reason,
large dumps are broken into a number
of reasonably sized media files.
The restore resumes with the next media file.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The exit code is 0 on normal completion,
and non-zero if an error occurred
or the restore was terminated by the operator.
.SH BUGS
Pathnames of restored non-directory files
(relative to the \f2destination\f1 directory)
must be 1023 characters (MAXPATHLEN) or less.
Longer pathnames are discarded
and a warning message displayed.
.P
There is no verify option to \f2xfsrestore\f1.
This would allow the operator to compare a filesystem dump to
an existing filesystem,
without actually doing a restore.
.P
The interactive commands (\f3\-i\f1 option) do not understand
regular expressions.
.P
When the minimal rmt option is specified, \f2xfsrestore\f1 applies it to 
all remote tape sources. The same blocksize (specified by the 
.B \-b
option) is used for all these remote drives.
.P
.I xfsrestore
uses the alert program only when a media change is required. 
.P
Cumulative mode (\f3\-r\f1 option) requires that the operator invoke
.I xfsrestore
for the base and for each delta to be applied in sequence to the base.
It would be better to allow the operator to identify the last delta
in the sequence of interest,
and let
.I xfsrestore
work backwards from that delta to identify
and apply the preceding deltas and base dump,
all in one invocation.
