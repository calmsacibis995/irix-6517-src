.SH NAME
named, named-xfer \- internet domain name server (DNS)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f3named\f1 [\f3\-d\f1 debuglevel] [\f3\-q\f1] [\f3\-r\f1] [\f3\-p\f1 remote/local] [{\f3\-b\f1} bootfile]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I named
is the Internet domain name server.
It replaces the original host table lookup of information in the
network hosts file \f2/etc/hosts\fP.
(See RFC1034 for more information on the Internet name-domain system.)
.I named-xfer
is invoked by
.I named
to transfer zone data from primary servers.
.PP
.I named
is started at system initialization if the configuration flag
.I named
is set
.B on
with
.IR chkconfig (1M).
Without any arguments,
.I named
reads the default boot file
.IR /etc/named.boot ,
read any initial data and listen for queries.
.PP
Site-dependent
options and arguments to
.I named
belong in the file
.IR /etc/config/named.options .
Options are:
.TP
.B \-d
Print debugging information.
A number after the
.B \-d
determines the level of
messages printed.
.TP
.B \-q
Print all sorts of query log information.
Used only for debugging.
.TP
.B \-p
Use a different port number.
The default is the standard port number
as listed in
.IR /etc/services ,
number 53.
The first port number given
is the one to which we send queries.
The second port number (after the
slash) is the one on which we listen.
If only one is given
without a slash, that number is used for both sending and listening.
.TP
.B \-b
Use an alternate boot file.
This is optional and allows you to
specify a file with a leading dash.
.TP
.B \-r
Turns recursion off in the server.  Answers can come only from local
(primary or secondary) zones.  This can be used on root servers.
\fINOTE:\fP this option is deprecated in favour
of the boot file directive ``options no-recursion''.
.PP
Any additional argument is taken as the name of the boot file.
If multiple boot files are specified, only the last is used.
.PP
The boot file contains information about where the name server is to get
its initial data.  
Lines in the boot file cannot be continued on subsequent lines.
The following is a small example:
.nf

.DT
.fi
.in
The ``directory'' line causes the server to change its working directory to
the directory specified.  This can be important for the correct processing
of \s-1$INCLUDE\s+1 files in primary zone files.
.LP
The ``cache'' line specifies that data in ``root.cache'' is to be placed in
the backup cache.  Its main use is to specify data such as locations of root
domain servers.  This cache is not used during normal operation, but is used
as ``hints'' to find the current root servers.  The file ``root.cache'' is
in the same format as ``berkeley.edu.zone''.  There can be more than one
``cache'' file specified.  The ``root.cache'' file should be retrieved
periodically from \s-1FTP.RS.INTERNIC.NET\s+1 since it contains a list of
root servers, and this list changes periodically.
.LP
The first example ``primary'' line states that the file
``berkeley.edu.zone'' contains authoritative data for the ``Berkeley.EDU''
zone.  The file ``berkeley.edu.zone'' contains data in the master file
format described in RFC 883.  All domain names are relative to the origin, in
this case, ``Berkeley.EDU'' (see below for a more detailed description).
The second ``primary'' line states that the file ``ucbhosts.rev'' contains
authoritative data for the domain ``32.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA,'' which is used to
translate addresses in network 128.32 to hostnames.  Each master file should
begin with an SOA record for the zone (see below).
.LP
The first example ``secondary'' line specifies that all authoritative data
under ``CC.Berkeley.EDU'' is to be transferred from the name server at
128.32.137.8.  If the transfer fails it will try 128.32.137.3 and continue
trying the addresses, up to 10, listed on this line.  The secondary copy is
also authoritative for the specified domain.  The first non-dotted-quad
address on this line will be taken as a filename in which to backup the
transferred zone.  The name server will load the zone from this backup file
if it exists when it boots, providing a complete copy even if the master
servers are unreachable.  Whenever a new copy of the domain is received by
automatic zone transfer from one of the master servers, this file will be
updated.  If no file name is given, a temporary file will be used, and will
be deleted after each successful zone transfer.  This is not recommended
since it is a needless waste of bandwidth.  The second example ``secondary''
line states that the address-to-hostname mapping for the subnet 128.32.136
should be obtained from the same list of master servers as the previous zone.
.LP
The ``forwarders'' line specifies the addresses of sitewide servers that
will accept recursive queries from other servers.  If the boot file
specifies one or more forwarders, then the server will send all queries for
data not in the cache to the forwarders first.  Each forwarder will be asked
in turn until an answer is returned or the list is exhausted.  If no answer
is forthcoming from a forwarder, the server will continue as it would have
without the forwarders line unless it is in ``forward-only'' mode.  The
forwarding facility is useful to cause a large sitewide cache to be
generated on a master, and to reduce traffic over links to outside servers.
It can also be used to allow servers to run that do not have direct access
to the Internet, but wish to look up exterior names anyway.
.LP
The ``slave'' line (deprecated) is allowed for backward compatibility.  Its
meaning is identical to ``options forward-only''.
.LP
The ``sortlist'' line can be used to indicate networks that are to be
preferred over other networks.  Queries for host addresses from hosts on the
same network as the server will receive responses with local network
addresses listed first, then addresses on the sort list, then other
addresses.
.LP
The ``xfrnets'' directive (not shown) can be used to implement primitive
access control.  If this directive is given, then your name server will
only answer zone transfer requests from hosts which are on networks listed
in your ``xfrnets'' directives.  This directive may also be given as
``tcplist'' for compatibility with older, interim servers.
.LP
The ``include'' directive (not shown) can be used to process the contents
of some other file as though they appeared in place of the ``include''
directive.  This is useful if you have a lot of zones or if you have 
logical groupings of zones which are maintained by different people.
The ``include'' directive takes one argument, that being the name of the
file whose contents are to be included.  No quotes are necessary around
the file name.
.LP
The ``bogusns'' directive (not shown) tells \s-1BIND\s+1 that no queries
are to be sent to the specified name server addresses (which are specified
as dotted quads, not as domain names).  This is useful when you know that
some popular server has bad data in a zone or cache, and you want to avoid
contamination while the problem is being fixed.
.LP
The ``limit'' directive can be used to change \s-1BIND\s+1's internal limits,
some of which (\fBdatasize\fP, for example) are implemented by the system and
others (like \fBtransfers-in\fP) by \s-1BIND\s+1 itself.  The number following
the limit name can be scaled by postfixing a ``k,'' ``m,'' or ``g'' for
kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes respectively.
\fBdatasize\fP's argument sets the process data size enforced by the kernel.
\fINote:\fP not all systems provide a call to implement this -- on such
systems, the use of the \fBdatasize\fP parameter of ``limit'' will result in
a warning message.
\fBtransfers-in\fP's argument is the number of \fInamed-xfer\fP subprocesses
which \s-1BIND\s+1 will spawn at any one time.
\fBtransfers-per-ns\fP's argument is the maximum number of zone transfers to
be simultaneously initiated to any given remote name server.
.LP
The ``options'' directive introduces a boolean specifier that changes the
behaviour of \s-1BIND\s+1.  More than one option can be specified in a single
directive.  The currently defined options are as follows:
\fBno-recursion\fP, which will cause \s-1BIND\s+1 to answer with a referral
rather than actual data whenever it receives a query for a name it is not
authoritative for -- don't set this on a server that is listed in any host's
\fIresolv.conf\fP file;
\fBno-fetch-glue\fP, which keeps \s-1BIND\s+1 from fetching missing glue when
constructing the ``additional data'' section of a response; this can be used
in conjunction with \fBno-recursion\fP to prevent \s-1BIND\s+1's cache from
ever growing in size or becoming corrupted;
\fBquery-log\fP, which causes all queries to be logged via
syslog(@SYS_OPS_EXT@) -- this is a lot of data, don't turn it on lightly;
\fBforward-only\fP, which causes the server to query only its forwarders --
this option is normally used on machine that wishes to run a server but for
physical or administrative reasons cannot be given access to the Internet;
and \fBfake-iquery\fP, which tells \s-1BIND\s+1 to send back a useless and
bogus reply to ``inverse queries'' rather than responding with an error.
.LP
The ``check-names'' directive tells \s-1BIND\s+1 to check names in either
``primary'' or ``secondary'' zone files, or in messages (``response'')
received during recursion (for example, those which would be forwarded back
to a firewalled requestor).  For each type of name,
\s-1BIND\s+1 can be told to ``fail'', such that a zone would not be loaded
or a response would not be cached or forwarded, or merely ``warn'' which
would cause a message to be emitted in the system operations logs, or to
``ignore'' the badness of a name and process it in the traditional fashion.
Names are considered good if they match RFC 952's expectations (if they are
host names), or if they consist only of printable \s-1ASCII\s+1 characters
(if they are not host names).
.LP
The ``max-fetch'' directive (not shown) is allowed for backward compatibility;
its meaning is identical to ``limit transfers-in''.
.LP
The ``transfer'' directive (not shown) defines a alternate transfer program
(other than named-xfer) to be used for a specific domain.  This directive
implements RFC1794.   Use of the transfer directive disables ALL record
reordering for all domains being serviced by (this) named.  Use of this
option should be used with care.  To use transfer, named.boot will have a
transfer and secondary pair of directives for each effected domain.  Syntax
of the paired transfer and secondary directives looks like.
.RS
.nf

transfer <domain> <xfer-program>
secondary <domain> 127.0.0.1 <filename>

.fi
.RE
.PP
The master file consists of control information
and a list of resource records for objects in the zone
of the forms:
.Ex
$INCLUDE <filename> <opt_domain>
$ORIGIN <domain>
<domain> <opt_ttl> <opt_class> <type> <resource_record_data>
.Ee
where
.I domain
is "." for root, "@" for the current origin, or a standard domain
name. If
.I domain
is a standard domain name that does not end with ``.'', the current origin
is appended to the domain. Domain names ending with ``.'' are
unmodified.
The
.I opt_domain
field is used to define an origin for the data in an included file.
It is equivalent to placing a $ORIGIN statement before the first
line of the included file.  The field is optional.
Neither the
.I opt_domain
field nor $ORIGIN statements in the included file modify the current origin
for this file.
The
.I opt_ttl
field is an optional integer number for the time-to-live field.
It defaults to zero, meaning the minimum value specified in the SOA
record for the zone.
The
.I opt_class
field is the object address type; currently only one type is supported,
.BR IN ,
for objects connected to the Internet.
The
.I type
field contains one of the following tokens; the data expected in the
.I resource_record_data
field is in parentheses.
.TP "\w'MINFO    'u"
A
a host address (dotted quad)
.IP NS
an authoritative name server (domain)
.IP MX
a mail exchanger (domain), preceded by a preference value (0..32767),
with lower numeric values representing higher logical preferences.
.IP CNAME
the canonical name for an alias (domain)
.IP SOA
marks the start of a zone of authority (domain of originating host,
domain address of maintainer, a serial number and the following
parameters in seconds: refresh, retry, expire and minimum TTL (see RFC 883)).
.IP NULL
a null resource record (no format or data)
.IP RP
a Responsible Person for some domain name (mailbox, TXT-referral)
.IP PTR
a domain name pointer (domain)
.IP HINFO
host information (cpu_type OS_type)
.PP
Resource records normally end at the end of a line,
but may be continued across lines between opening and closing parentheses.
Comments are introduced by semicolons and continue to the end of the line.
.PP
Each master zone file should begin with an SOA record for the zone.
An example SOA record is as follows:
.Ex
@	IN	SOA	ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU. rwh.ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU. (
				1989020501	; serial
				10800	; refresh
				3600	; retry
				3600000	; expire
				86400 )	; minimum
.fi
.LP
The SOA specifies a serial number, which should be changed each time the
master file is changed.  Note that the serial number can be given as a
dotted number, but this is a \fIvery\fP unwise thing to do since the
translation to normal integers is via concatenation rather than
multiplication and addition.  You can spell out the year, month, day of
month, and 0..99 version number and still fit inside the unsigned 32-bit
size of this field.  It's true that we will have to rethink this strategy in
the year 4294 (Greg.) but we're not worried about it.  Secondary servers
check the serial number at intervals specified by the refresh time in
seconds; if the serial number changes, a zone transfer will be done to load
the new data.  If a master server cannot be contacted when a refresh is due,
the retry time specifies the interval at which refreshes should be attempted.
If a master server cannot be contacted within the interval given by the
expire time, all data from the zone is discarded by secondary servers.
The minimum value is the time-to-live used by records in the file
with no explicit time-to-live value.
.SH NOTES
The boot file directives ``domain'' and ``suffixes'' have been
obsoleted by a more useful resolver based implementation of
suffixing for partially qualified domain names.
The prior mechanisms
could fail under a number of situations, especially when then local
nameserver did not have complete information.
.sp
The following signals have the specified effect when sent to the
server process using the
.IR kill (1)
or
.IR killall (1M)
commands.
.IP SIGHUP 10
Causes server to read
.I named.boot
and reload the database.
.IP SIGINT 10
Dumps current data base and cache to
.IR /var/tmp/named_dump.db .
.IP SIGABRT 10
Dumps statistics data into
.IR /var/tmp/named.stats .
Statistics data is appended to the file.
.IP SIGUSR1 10
Turns on debugging; each SIGUSR1 increments debug level.
.IP SIGUSR2 10
Turns off debugging completely.
.PP
The shell script
.I /usr/sbin/named.reload
sends a SIGHUP to the server.
.I /usr/sbin/named.restart
kills and restarts the server.
