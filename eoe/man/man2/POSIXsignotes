.RS 8
Upon receipt of the signal

.I function address\^

.RS 8
Upon receipt of the signal

the receiving process is to execute the signal-catching function whose
address is specified via this parameter.
The function will be invoked as follows:
.PP
.RS

.B "handler (int sig, int code, struct sigcontext \(**sc);"
.fi
.RE

Where
.I handler
is the specified function-name.

The third argument
.I sc\^
is a pointer to a
.I struct sigcontext
(defined in <\f2sys/signal.h\f1>)
that contains the processor context at the time of the signal.
.PP
The signal-catching function remains installed after it is invoked.
During normal return from the signal-catching handler,
the system signal action is restored to
.I func\^
and any held signal of this type released.
If a non-local goto
.RI ( longjmp )
is taken, then
.I sigrelse\^
must be called to restore the system signal action
and release any held signal of this type.
.PP
Upon return from the signal-catching function, the receiving process will
resume execution at the point it was interrupted.
See
.SM WARNINGS
below.
.PP
When a signal that is to be caught occurs during a 
.IR read "(2), a"  " write" (2),
.RI an " open" "(2), or an " ioctl (2)\^
system call on a slow device (like a terminal; but not a file), during a
.IR pause (2)
system call, or during a
.IR wait (2)
system call that does not return immediately due to the existence of a
previously stopped or zombie
process, the signal catching function will be executed and then the
interrupted system call may return a \-1 to the calling process with
.I errno\^
set to \f3\s-1EINTR\s+1\fP.

the handler parameter

or

the action to be taken is the same as that described above for
a handler parameter
equal to

The same is true if the signal is
.SM
.B SIGCLD
with one exception:
while the process is executing the signal-catching function,
all terminating child processes will be queued.
The \f2wait\f1
system call removes the first entry of the queue.
Unlike \f2signal\fP(2) and \f2sigset\fP(2), re-attaching the
handler before exiting it will 
.SM NOT
ensure that no 
.SM
.BR SIGCLD 's
will be missed.  See 
.IR wait (2)
for an example of parent code waiting on children.
.PP
When processing a pipeline, the shell
makes the last process in the pipeline the parent of the proceeding processes.
A process that may be piped into in this manner (and thus become the parent
of other processes) should take care not to set
.SM
.B SIGCLD
to be caught.

.B \s-1SIGPOLL\s+1
is issued when a file descriptor corresponding
to a \s-1STREAMS\s0 [see \f2intro\f1(2)] file has a "selectable" event pending.
A process must specifically request that this signal be sent
using the \f3\s-1I_SETSIG\s0\fP \f2ioctl\fP call.
Otherwise, the process will never receive

The signals \f3\s-1SIGSTOP\s+1\f1, \f3\s-1SIGTSTP\s+1\f1,
\f3\s-1SIGTTIN\s+1\f1, \f3\s-1SIGTTOU\s+1\f1
and \f3\s-1SIGCONT\s+1\f1 are used by command interpreters like the C shell
[see \f2csh\f1(1)] to provide job control.
The first four signals listed will cause the receiving process to be
stopped, unless the signal is caught or ignored.
\f3\s-1SIGCONT\s+1\f1 causes a stopped process to be resumed.
\f3\s-1SIGTSTP\s+1\f1 is sent from the terminal driver in response
to the 
.SM SWTCH
character being entered from the keyboard [see \f2termio\f1(7)].
\f3\s-1SIGTTIN\s+1\f1 is sent from the terminal driver when a background
process attempts to read from its controlling terminal.
If \f3\s-1SIGTTIN\s+1\f1 is ignored by the process, then the read will
return \f3\s-1EIO\s+1\f1.
\f3\s-1SIGTTOU\s+1\f1 is sent from the terminal driver when a background
process attempts to write to its controlling terminal when the
terminal is in \f3\s-1TOSTOP\s+1\f1 mode.
If \f3\s-1SIGTTOU\s+1\f1 is ignored by the process, then the write will
succeed regardless of the state of the controlling terminal.
