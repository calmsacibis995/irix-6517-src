.SH SYNOPSIS

\f3#include <unistd.h>\f1
.sp .8v
\f3int getspinfo(struct acct_spi *spi);\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f2getspinfo\f1 function stores the service provider information
for the array session containing the current process into the
\f3acct_spi\f1 struct pointed to by \f2spi\f1.
.PP
The service provider information for an array session is normally
inherited from the array session of the process that created it, or it
can be changed with the privileged \f2setspinfo\f1(2) function.
For more details on service provider information, see the man pages for
\f2setspinfo\f1(2).
.PP
\f2getspinfo\f1 is provided primarily for compatibility with previous
releases of IRIX.
A somewhat more general mechanism for doing the same thing is provided
by the \f3ARSOP_GETSPI\f1 function of \f2arsop\f1(2).
