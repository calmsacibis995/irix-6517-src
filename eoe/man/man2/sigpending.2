.B "int sigpending (sigset_t \(**maskptr);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I sigpending
returns the set of signals pending for the calling thread
(i.e., blocked from delivery) in the space pointed to by
.I maskptr.
.PP
Routines described in

are used to

.TP 15
.SM
\%[EFAULT]
.I maskptr
points to memory that is not a part of process's valid address space.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
A 0 value indicates that the call succeeded.  A \-1 return value
indicates an error occurred and
.I errno
is set to indicate the reason.
