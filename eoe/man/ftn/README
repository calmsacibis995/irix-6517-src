This subtree builds the Fortran version of IRIX manpages for routines
in various libraries that are called from Fortran.

This subtree contains no manual page source files, only Makefiles.

The Makefiles make symlinks to the manual page source, which lives
in the irix/man/man* directories.  This is done to avoid adding
more targets and complexity to the trees and Makefiles under
irix/man/man*.

The source pages which need to be made differently for Fortran
can be recognized by searching for pages which contain the
nroff construct:

.Op f

The resulting .z files end up in the Fortran images, but are built
when running a make in the IRIX ISM.  When final customer images
are built, the files with IRIX IDB tags of irix.man.ftn get
stripped out of IRIX and packaged with the Fortran images.
