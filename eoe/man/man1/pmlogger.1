.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmlogger
creates the archive logs of performance metric values
that may be ``played back'' by other Performance Co-Pilot (see
.BR PCPIntro (1))
tools.  These logs form the basis of the VCR paradigm and retrospective
performance analysis services common to the PCP toolkit.
.PP
The mandatory argument
.I archive
is the base name for the physical files that constitute
an archive log.
.PP
The 
.B \-V
option specifies whether a version 1 or version 2 archive is generated.
A version 2 archive also stores the associated Performance Metrics 
Name Space (PMNS). By default a version 2 archive is generated.
.PP
Unless directed to another host by the
.B \-h
option,
.B pmlogger
will contact the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon
(PMCD) on the local host and use that as the source of the metric
values to be logged.
.PP
To support the required flexibility and control over what is logged and 
when,
.B pmlogger
maintains an independent two level logging state for each instance 
of each performance metric.
At the first (mandatory) level, logging is 
allowed to be
.B on
(with an associated interval between samples), or
.B off
or
.BR maybe .
In the latter case, the second (advisory) level logging is allowed 
to be
.B on
(with an associated interval between samples), or
.BR off .
.PP
The 
mandatory level allows universal specification that some metrics must be 
logged, or must
.B not
be logged.  The default state for all instances of all metrics when 
.B pmlogger
starts is mandatory maybe and advisory off.
.PP
Use
.BR pmlc (1)
to interrogate and change the logging state once
.B pmlogger
is running.
.PP
If a metric's state is mandatory (on or off) and a request is made to change it
to mandatory maybe, the new state is mandatory maybe and advisory off.  If a
metric's state is already advisory (on or off) and a request is made to change
it to mandatory maybe, the current state is retained.
.PP
It is not possible for
.B pmlogger
to log specific instances of a metric and all instances of the same metric
concurrently.  If specific instances are being logged and a request to log all
instances is made, then all instances of the metric will be logged according to
the new request, superseding any prior logging request for the metric.  A
request to log all instances of a metric will supersede any previous request to
log all instances.  A request to log specific instances of a metric when all
instances are already being logged is refused.  To do this one must turn off
logging for all instances of the metric first.  In each case, the validity of
the request is checked first; for example a request to change a metric's
logging state to advisory on when it is currently mandatory off is never
permitted (it is necessary to change the state to mandatory maybe first).
.PP
Optionally, each system running
.BR pmcd (1)
may also be configured to run a ``primary''
.B pmlogger
instance.
Like
.BR pmcd (1),
this
.B pmlogger
instance is launched by 
.BR /etc/init.d/pcp ,
and is affected by the files
.I /etc/config/pmlogger
(use
.BR chkconfig (1M)
to activate or disable the primary
.B pmlogger 
instance),
.I /etc/config/pmlogger.options
(command line options passed to the primary
.BR pmlogger )
and
.I /var/pcp/config/pmlogger/config.default
(the default initial configuration file for the primary
.BR pmlogger ).
.PP
The primary
.B pmlogger
instance is identified by the
.B \-P
option.  There may be at most one ``primary''
.B pmlogger
instance on each system with an active
.BR pmcd (1).
The primary
.B pmlogger
instance (if any)
must be running on the same host as the
.BR pmcd (1)
to which it connects, so the
.B \-h
and
.B \-P
options are mutually exclusive.
.PP
When launched as a non-primary instance,
.B pmlogger
will exit immediately if the configuration
file causes no metric logging to be scheduled.  The
.B \-L
option overrides this behavior, and causes a non-primary
.B pmlogger
instance to ``linger'', presumably pending some future
dynamic re-configuration and state change via
.BR pmlc (1).
.B pmlogger
will also linger without the 
.B \-L
option being used if all the metrics to be logged are logged
as once only metrics. When the once only metrics have been
logged, a warning message will be generated stating
that the event queue is empty and no more events will be scheduled.
.PP
By default all diagnostics and errors from
.B pmlogger
are written to the file
.I pmlogger.log
in the directory where
.B pmlogger
is launched.
The
.B \-l
option may be used to override the default behavior.
If the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
written to standard error instead.
.PP
If specified, the
.B \-s
option instructs
.B pmlogger
to terminate after a certain size in records, bytes or time units
has been accumulated. 
If 
.IR endsize
is an integer then
.IR endsize
records will be written to the log.
If 
.IR endsize
is suffixed by  
.B b 
or
.B bytes
then 
.IR endsize
bytes of the archive data will be written out
(note, however, that archive log record boundaries will not be broken and
so this limit may be slightly surpassed).
Other viable file size units include:
.BR K ,
.BR Kb ,
.BR Kilobyte
for kilobytes and
.BR M ,
.BR Mb ,
.BR Megabyte
for megabytes.
These units may be optionally suffixed by an 
.B s 
and may be of mixed case.
Alternatively
.IR endsize
may be suffixed using a time unit
as described in
.BR PCPIntro (1) 
for the
.I interval
argument (to the standard PCP tool option
.BR \-t ).
.nf
Some examples of different formats:
.in1i
.B \-s 100 
.B \-s 100bytes
.B \-s 100K 
.B \-s 100Mb
.B \-s 10mins
.B \-s 10hours
.in
.fi
The default is for
.B pmlogger
to run forever.
.PP
The
.B \-r
option causes the size of the physical record(s) for each
group of metrics and the expected contribution of
the group to the size of the PCP archive for one full day
of collection to be reported in the log file.  This
information is reported
the first time each group is successfully written
to the archive.
.PP
The log file is potentially a multi-volume data set, and the
.B \-v
option causes
.B pmlogger
to start a new volume after a certain size in records, bytes,
or time units has been accumulated for the current volume.
The format of this size specification is identical to that
of the
.B \-s
option (see above).
The default is for
.B pmlogger
to create a single volume log.
Additional volume switches can also be forced asynchronously by
either using
.BR pmlc (1)
or sending
.B pmlogger
a SIGHUP signal (see below). Note, if a scheduled volume
switch is in operation due to the 
.B \-v
option, then its counters will be reset after an 
asynchronous switch.  
.PP
Normally
.B pmlogger
operates on the distributed Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS),
however if the
.B \-n
option is specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded
from the file
.IR pmnsfile.
.PP
Under normal circumstances,
.B pmlogger
will run forever (except for a 
.B \-s 
option or a termination signal).
The
.B \-T
option may be used to limit the execution time using the format
of time as prescribed by 
.BR PCPIntro (1). 
.nf
Some examples of different formats:
.in1i
.B \-T 10mins 
.B \-T '@ 11:30' 
.in
.fi
From this it can be seen that 
.B \-T 10mins
and
.B \-s 10mins
perform identical actions. 
.PP
When
.B pmlogger
receives a SIGHUP signal, the current volume of the log is closed, and
a new volume is opened.  This mechanism (or the alternative mechanism
via
.BR pmlc (1))
may be used to manage the growth of the log files \- once a log volume
is closed, that file may be archived without ill-effect on the
continued operation of
.BR pmlogger .
See also the
.B \-v
option above.
.PP
The buffers for the current log may be flushed to disk using the
\f3flush\f1 command of
.BR pmlc (1),
or by sending
.B pmlogger
a SIGUSR1 signal.
This is useful when the log needs to be read while
.B pmlogger
is still running.
.P
When launched with the 
.B -x 
option, pmlogger will accept asynchronous
control requests on the file descriptor \f2fd\f1.  This option is only
expected to be used internally by PCP applications that support ``live
record mode'' via 
.BR pmRecordControl (3).
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
The configuration file may be specified with the
.B \-c
option.  If it is not, configuration specifications are read from standard
input.
.PP
If
.I configfile
does not exist, then a search is made in the directory
.I /var/pcp/config/pmlogger
for a file of the same name, and if found that file is used,
e.g. if 
.I config.mumble
does not exist in the current directory and
the file
.I /var/pcp/config/pmlogger/config.mumble
does exist, then
.B "\-c config.mumble"
and
.B "\-c /var/pcp/config/pmlogger/config.mumble"
are equivalent.
.PP
The syntax for the configuration file is as follows.
.IP 1.
Words are separated by white space (space, tab or newline).
.IP 2.
The symbol ``#'' (hash) introduces a comment, and all text up
to the next newline
is ignored.
.IP 3.
Keywords (shown in
.B bold
below) must appear literally (i.e. in lower case).
.IP 4.
Each specification begins with the optional keyword
.BR log ,
followed by one of the states
.BR "mandatory on" ,
.BR "mandatory off" ,
.BR "mandatory maybe" ,
.BR "advisory on"
or
.BR "advisory off" .
.IP 5.
For the
.B on
states, a logging interval must follow using the syntax ``\c
.BR once '',
or ``\c
.BR default '',
or ``\c
.B every
.IR "N timeunits" '',
or simply ``\c
.IR "N timeunits" ''
\-
.I N
is an unsigned integer, and
.I timeunits
is one of the keywords
.BR msec ,
.BR millisecond ,
.BR sec ,
.BR second ,
.BR min ,
.BR minute ,
.BR hour
or the plural form of one of the above.
.sp0.5v
Internal limitations require the
interval
to be smaller than (approximately)
74 hours.  An
interval
value of zero is a synonym for
.BR once .
.sp0.5v
An interval of
.B default
means to use the default logging interval of
60 seconds; this default value may be changed to
.I interval
with the
.B \-t
command line option.
The
.I interval
argument follows the syntax described in
.BR PCPIntro (1),
and in the simplest form may be an unsigned integer (the implied
units in this case are seconds).
.IP 6.
Following the state and possible interval specifications comes
a ``{'', followed by a list of one or more metric specifications
and a closing ``}''.
The list is white space (or comma) separated.
If there is only one metric specification in the list, the braces are optional.
.IP 7.
A metric specification consists of a metric name optionally
followed by a set of instance names.
The metric name follows the standard PCP naming conventions, see
.BR pmns (4),
and if the metric name
is a non-leaf node in the PMNS (see \c
.BR pmns (4)),
then
.B pmlogger
will recursively descend the PMNS and apply the logging specification
to all descendent metric names that are leaf nodes in the PMNS.
The set of instance names
is a ``['', followed by a list
of one or more space (or comma) separated
names, numbers or strings, and a closing ``]''.
Elements in the list that are numbers are assumed to be
internal instance identifiers, other elements are assumed to
be external instance identifiers \- see
.BR pmGetInDom (3)
for more information.
.RS
.PP
If no instances are given, then the logging specification
is applied to all instances of the associated metric.
.RE
.IP 8.
There may be an arbitrary number of logging specifications.
.IP 9.
Following all of the logging specifications, there may be an optional
access control section, introduced by the literal token
.BR [access] .
Thereafter come access control rules of the form ``\c
.B allow
.I hostlist
.B :
.I operation
.BR ; ''
and ``\c
.B disallow
.I hostlist
.B :
.I operation
.BR ; ''.

The base
.I operations
are
.BR advisory ,
.BR mandatory
and
.BR enquire .
In all other aspects, these access control statements follow the syntactic
and semantic rules defined for the access control mechanisms used
by PMCD
and are fully documented in
.BR pmcd (1).
.SH EXAMPLES
For each PCP utility, there is a sample
.B pmlogger
configuration file that could be used to create an archive log suitable
for replaying with that tool (i.e. includes all of the performance
metrics used by the tool).
For a tool named
.I foo
this configuration file is located in
.IR /var/pcp/config/pmlogger/config.foo .
.PP
The following is a simple default configuration file for a primary
.B pmlogger
instance, and demonstrates most of the capabilities of the
configuration specification language.
.PP

.SH AUTOMATIC RESTART
It is often useful for
.B pmlogger
processes (other than the primary instance)
to be started and stopped when the local host is booted
or shutdown.
The script
.I /etc/init.d/pcplocal
and the necessary soft-links are provided,
and can be modified by
.B root
to run PCP tools automatically.
If you want to find
out more before starting, read the manual pages for
.BR rc2 (1),
.BR rc0 (1),
.BR shutdown (1)
and the file
.IR /etc/init.d/README .
.P
For example, changing
.I /etc/init.d/pcplocal
so that it contains:
.P
.ftCW
.in+4n
.nf
'start') 
# Add startup actions here 
(/usr/pcp/bin/pmlogger_check &) 
;; 

'stop')
# Add shutdown actions here
killall -INT pmlogger
;;
.ftP
.in
.fi
.P
will start
.B pmlogger
instances at boot time and terminate them in an orderly
fashion at system shutdown.
.P
This script runs as
.BR root ,
so any
.I pmlogger
instances it launches are also run as
.BR root .
To run some
.B pmlogger
instances as a
particular user, create your own archive logger control file (see
.BR pmlogger_check (1))
and use the
.BR su (1)
command. e.g.
.P
.ftCW
.in+4n
.nf
'start') 
# Add startup actions here 
(su tanya -c "/usr/pcp/bin/pmlogger_check -c /usr/people/tanya/ctl" &) 
;; 
.ftP
.in
.fi
.P
at boot time
will start the
.B pmlogger
instances described in
.IR /usr/people/tanya/ctl ,
running as user
.BR tanya .

Normally
.B pmlogger
creates a socket to receive control messages from

.PP
If you have the PCP product,
relevant information is also available from the on-line PCP
Tutorial.  Provided the
.B pcp.man.tutorial
subsystem from the PCP images has been installed, access the URL
.B file:/var/pcp/Tutorial/archive.html
from your web browser.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The archive logs are sufficiently precious that
.B pmlogger
will not truncate an existing physical file.  A message of the form
.br
.in+05.v
__pmLogNewFile: "foo.index" already exists, not over-written
.br
__pmLogCreate: File exists
.in
indicates this situation has arisen.  You must explicitly remove
the files and launch
.B pmlogger
again.
.PP
There may be at most one primary
.B pmlogger
instance per monitored host; attempting to bend this rule produces the error:
.br
.in+05v
pmlogger: there is already a primary pmlogger running
.in
.PP
Various other messages relating to the creation and/or deletion of
files in
.I /var/tmp/pmlogger
suggest a permission problem on this directory, or some feral
files have appeared therein.
