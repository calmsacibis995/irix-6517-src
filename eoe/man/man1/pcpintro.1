..
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is an SGI product designed for monitoring
and managing system-level performance.
These services are distributed and scalable 
to accommodate the most complex system configurations and performance 
problems.
.PP
From the perspective of 
.BR inst (1)
or
.BR swmgr (1)
PCP is composed of two products as follows:
.IP \fIpcp_eoe\fR 1i
For IRIX 6.5, this is included in the IRIX CD set.
For other IRIX versions, this comes from the PCP product distribution.
.IP \fIpcp\fR 1i
From the PCP product distribution
.PP
This manual entry describes the high-level features
and options common to the images within both the
.I pcp_eoe
and
.I pcp
products.
.SH OVERVIEW
The PCP architecture is distributed in the 
sense that any PCP tool may be executing remotely.  On
the host (or hosts) being monitored, each domain of performance
metrics, whether IRIX, a service layer, a database management system, a web server, an application,  etc.
requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
which is responsible for collecting performance 
measurements from that domain.
All PMDAs
are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon
.RB ( pmcd (1))
on the same host.
.PP
Client applications (the monitoring tools) connect to
.BR pmcd (1),
which
acts as a router for requests, by
forwarding requests to the appropriate
PMDA and returning the responses to the clients.
Clients may also access performance data from a PCP archive
(created using
.BR pmlogger (1))
for retrospective analysis.
.PP
The following performance monitoring applications may be launched
directly from the command line, or from the
.B PerfTools
page of the IRIX Interactive Desktop\(tm Icon Catalog.
.PP
Each tool or command is documented completely in its
own reference page.
.TP

metrics.
.SH COMMON COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
There is a set of common command line arguments that are used consistently
by most PCP tools.
.TP
.BI "\-a " archive
Performance metric information is retrospectively retrieved 
from the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
.IR archive ,
previously generated by 
.BR pmlogger (1). 
The
.B \-a
and
.B \-h
options are mutually exclusive.
.TP
.BI "\-a " archive\f1[ , archive , \f1...]
An alternate form of
.B \-a
for applications that are able to handle multiple
archives.
.TP
.BI "\-h " hostname
Unless directed to another host by the
.B \-h
option,
or to an archive by the
.B \-a
option,
the source of performance metrics will be
the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD)
on the local host.
The
.B \-a
and
.B \-h
options are mutually exclusive.
.TP
.BI "\-n " pmnsfile
Normally the
distributed Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) is
used, however if the
.B \-n
option is specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded
from the file
.IR pmnsfile .
.TP
.BI "\-s " samples
The argument
.I samples
defines the number of samples to be retrieved and reported.
If
.I samples
is 0 or
.B \-s
is not specified, the application
will sample and report continuously (in real time mode) or until the end
of the PCP archive (in archive mode).
.TP
.B \-z
Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the
host that is the source of the performance metrics, as identified via
either the
.B \-h
or
.B \-a
options.
.TP
.BI "\-Z " timezone
By default, applications
report the time of day according to the local timezone on the
system where
the application is executed.
The
.B \-Z
option changes the timezone to
.I timezone
in the format of the environment variable
.B TZ
as described in
.BR environ (5).
.SH INTERVAL SPECIFICATION AND ALIGNMENT
Most PCP tools operate with periodic sampling or
reporting, and the
.B \-t
and
.B \-A
options may be used to control the duration of the sample interval
and the alignment of the sample times.
.TP
.BI "\-t " interval
.RS
Set the update or reporting interval.
.PP
The
.I interval
argument
is specified as a sequence of one or more elements of the form
.nf
.in +1.0i
\f2number\f1[\f2units\f1]
.in
.fi
where \f2number\f1 is an integer or floating point constant (parsed using
.BR strtod (3C))
and the optional \f2units\f1 is one of:
.BR seconds ,
.BR second ,
.BR secs ,
.BR sec ,
.BR s ,
.BR minutes ,
.BR minute ,
.BR mins ,
.BR min ,
.BR m ,
.BR hours ,
.BR hour ,
.BR h ,
.BR days ,
.B day
and
.BR d .
If the
.I unit
is empty,
.B second
is assumed.
.PP
In addition, the upper case (or mixed case) version of any of the
above is also acceptable.
.PP
Spaces anywhere in the
.I interval
are ignored, so
.BR "4 days 6 hours 30 minutes" ,
.BR "4day6hour30min" ,
.B "4d6h30m"
and
.B "4d6.5h"
are all equivalent.
.PP
Multiple specifications are additive, e.g. ``\fB1hour 15mins 30secs\fR''
is interpreted as 3600+900+30 seconds.
.RE
.TP
.BI "\-A " align
.RS
By default samples are not necessarily aligned on
any natural unit of time.  The
.B \-A
option may be used to force the initial sample to be aligned on the
boundary of a natural time unit.
For example
.BR "\-A 1sec" ,
.B "\-A 30min"
and
.B "-A 1hour"
specify alignment on whole seconds, half and whole hours respectively.
.PP
The
.I align
argument follows the syntax for an
.I interval
argument described above for the
.B \-t
option.
.PP
Note that alignment occurs by advancing the time as required, and that
.B \-A
acts as a modifier to advance both the start of the time window
(see the next section)
and the origin time (if the
.B \-O
option is specified).
.RE
.SH TIME WINDOW SPECIFICATION
Many PCP tools are designed to operate in some time window of interest,
e.g. to define a termination time for real-time monitoring or to
define a start and end time within a PCP archive log.
.PP
In the absence of the
.B \-O
and
.B \-A
options to specify an initial sample time origin
and time alignment (see above), the PCP application
will retrieve the first sample at the start of the time window.
.PP
The following options may be used to specify a time window of interest.
.TP
.BI "\-S " starttime
.RS
By default the time window commences immediately in real-time mode,
or coincides with time at the start of the PCP archive log
in archive mode.
The
.B \-S
option may be used to specify a later time
for the start of the time window.
.P
The
.I starttime
parameter may be given in one of
three forms (\c
.I interval
is the same as for the
.B \-t
option as described above,
.I ctime
is described below):
.TP
\f2interval\f1
To specify an offset from the current time (in real-time mode) or
the beginning of a PCP archive (in archive mode) simply specify the
interval of time as the argument.  For example
.B "\-S 30min"
will set the start of the time window to be exactly 30 minutes from now in
real-time mode, or
exactly 30 minutes from
the start of a PCP archive.
.TP
\-\f2interval\f1
To specify an offset from the end of a PCP archive log, prefix the
\f2interval\f1 argument with a minus sign.  In this case, the
start of the time window precedes
the time at the end of archive by the given interval.
For example
.B "\-S \-1hour"
will set the start of the time window to be exactly one hour before the
time of the last sample in a PCP archive log.
.TP
@\f2ctime\f1
To specify the calendar date and time (local time in the reporting timezone)
for the start of the time window, use the
.BR ctime (3C)
syntax preceded by an at sign.  For example
.B "\-S '@ Mon Mar 4 13:07:47 1996'"
.RE
.TP
.BI "\-T " endtime
.RS
By default the end of the time window is unbounded
(in real-time mode) or aligned with the time at the end of a PCP archive
log (in archive mode).
The
.B \-T
option may be used to specify an earlier time for
the end of the time window.
.PP
The
.I endtime
parameter may be given in one of
three forms (\c
.I interval
is the same as for the
.B \-t
option as described above,
.I ctime
is described below):
.TP
\f2interval\f1
To specify an offset from the start of the time window
simply use the interval of time as the argument.  For example
.B "\-T 2h30m"
will set the end of the time window to be 2 hours and 30 minutes after
the start of the time window.
.TP
\-\f2interval\f1
To specify an offset back from the time at the end of a PCP archive log,
prefix the \f2interval\f1 argument with a minus sign.  For example
.B "\-T \-90m"
will set the end of the time window to be 90 minutes before the time of
the last sample in a PCP archive log.
.TP
@\f2ctime\f1
To specify the calendar date and time (local time in the reporting timezone)
for the end of the time window, use the
.BR ctime (3C)
syntax preceded by an at sign.  For example
.B "\-T '@ Mon Mar 4 13:07:47 1996'"
.RE
.TP
.BI "\-O " origin
.RS
By default samples are fetched from the start of the
time window (see description of
.B \-S
option) to the end of the time window (see description of
.B \-T
option).
The
.B \-O
option allows the specification of an origin within the time window
to be used as the initial sample time.  This
is useful for interactive use of a PCP tool with the
.BR pmtime (1)
VCR replay facility.
.PP
The \f2origin\f1 argument accepted by
.B \-O
conforms to the same syntax and semantics as the
.I starttime
argument for the
.B \-T
option.
.PP
For example
.B "\-O -0"
specifies that the initial position should be at the end of the
time window; this is most useful when wishing to replay ``backwards''
within the time window.
.RE
.PP
The \f2ctime\f1 argument for the
.BR \-O ,
.B \-S
and
.B \-T
options is based upon the
calendar date and time format of
.BR ctime (3C),
but may be a fully specified time string like
.B "Mon Mar  4 13:07:47 1996"
or a partially specified time like 
.BR "Mar 4 1996" ,
.BR "Mar 4" , 
.BR "Mar" , 
.B "13:07:50" 
or
.BR "13:08" .
.PP
For any missing low order fields, the default value of
0 is assumed for hours, minutes and seconds, 1 for day of the month and Jan for months.
Hence, the following are equivalent:
.B "\-S '@ Mar 1996'"
and
.BR "\-S '@ Mar 1 00:00:00 1996'" .
.PP
If any high order fields are missing, they are filled in by
starting with the
year, month and day from the current time (real-time mode) or
the time at the beginning of the PCP archive log (archive mode)
and advancing the
time until it matches the fields that are specified.
So, for example if the time window starts by default at
``Mon Mar 4 13:07:47 1996'',
then
.B "\-S @13:10"
corresponds to 13:10:00 on Mon Mar 4, 1996,
while
.B "\-S @10:00"
corresponds to 10:00:00 on Tue Mar 5, 1996 (note this is the
following day).
.PP
For greater precision than afforded by
.BR ctime (3C),
the seconds component may be a floating point number.
.P
Also the 12 hour clock (am/pm notation) is supported, so for example
.B "13:07"
and
.B "1:07 pm"
are equivalent.
.SH "PERFORMANCE METRICS \- NAMES AND IDENTIFIERS"
The number of performance metric names supported by PCP in IRIX
is of the order of a few thousand.
The PCP libraries and applications use an internal
identification scheme that unambiguously associates a single
integer with each known performance metric.
This integer is known as the Performance Metric Identifier, or PMID.
Although not a requirement,
PMIDs tend to have global consistency across
all systems, so a particular performance metric usually has the same
PMID.
.PP
For all users and most applications, direct use of the PMIDs would be inappropriate
(e.g. this would limit the range of accessible metrics, make the code
hard to maintain, force the user interface to be particularly baroque,
etc.).
Hence a Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS)
is used to provide external names and
a hierarchic classification for performance metrics.
A PMNS is
represented as a tree, with each node having a label, a pointer to
either a PMID (for leaf nodes) or a set of descendent
nodes in the PMNS (for non-leaf nodes).
.PP
A node label must begin with
an alphabetic character, followed by zero or more characters drawn
from the alphabetics, the digits and character \`_\' (underscore).
For alphabetic characters in a node label, upper and
lower case are distinguished.
.PP
By convention, the name of a performance metric is constructed by
concatenation of the node labels on a path through the PMNS from the
root node to a leaf node, with a ``.'' as a separator.
The root node in
the PMNS is unlabeled, so all names begin with the label associated
with one of the descendent nodes below the root node of the PMNS, e.g. \c
.CW "kernel.percpu.syscall".
Typically (although this is not a requirement)
there would be at most one name for each PMID in a PMNS.
For example
.CW kernel.all.cpu.idle
and
.CW disk.dev.read
are the unique names for two distinct performance
metrics, each with a unique PMID.
.PP
Groups of related PMIDs may be named
by naming a non-leaf node in the PMNS tree, e.g. \c
.CW disk .
.PP
There may be PMIDs with no associated name in a PMNS; this is most
likely to occur when specific PMIDs are not available in all systems,
e.g. if ORACLE is not installed on a system, there is no good reason
to pollute the PMNS with names for all of the ORACLE performance
metrics.
.PP
Note also that there is no requirement for the
PMNS to be the same on all systems, however in practice most
applications would be developed against a stable PMNS that was
assumed to be a subset of the PMNS on all systems.
Indeed the PCP distribution
includes a default local PMNS for just this purpose.
.PP
The default local PMNS is located at
.I /var/pcp/pmns/root
however the environment
variable
.B PMNS_DEFAULT
may be set to the full pathname of a different PMNS which will
then be used as the default local PMNS.
'\".PP
'\"Other complete versions of the PMNS suitable for assorted variants
'\"on the base PCP installation may be found in the files
'\".IR /var/pcp/pmns/root_* .
'\"For some PCP deployments on non-SGI platforms, the PMNS may be
'\"different, and in some cases very different.  Where possible, a hybrid
'\"PMNS that provides equivalence mappings between the IRIX names and
'\"the non-SGI PMIDs may be found in the files
'\".IR /var/pcp/pmns/equiv_* .
.PP
Most applications do not use the local PMNS, but rather
import parts of the PMNS as required from the
same place that performance metrics are fetched, i.e. from
.BR pmcd (1)
for live monitoring or from a PCP archive for retrospective
monitoring.
.PP
To explore the PMNS
use
.BR pminfo (1),
or if the PCP product is installed the Metric Selection browser within
.BR pmchart (1).
.SH PERFORMANCE METRIC SPECIFICATIONS
In configuration files and (to a lesser extent) command line options,
metric specifications adhere to the following syntax rules.
.PP
If the source of performance metrics is real-time from
.BR pmcd (1)
then the accepted
syntax is
.br
.ti+1i
.IB host : metric [ instance1 , instance2 \fR... \fB]
.PP
If the source of performance metrics is a PCP archive log then the
accepted syntax
is
.br
.ti+1i
.IB archive / metric [ instance1 , instance2 \fR... \fB]
.PP
The
.IB host :\fR,
.IB archive /
and
.BI [ instance1 , instance2 \fR... \fB]
components are all optional.
.PP
The
.B ,
delimiter in the list of instance names
may be replaced by white space.
.PP
Special characters in
.I instance
names may be escaped by surrounding the name in double quotes or preceding
the character with a backslash.
.PP
White space is ignored everywhere except within a quoted
.I instance
name.
.PP
An empty
.I instance
is silently ignored, and in particular
``\fB[]\fR'' is the same as no
.IR instance ,
while ``\fB[one,,,two]\fR'' is parsed as specifying just
the two instances ``\fBone\fP'' and ``\fBtwo\fP''.
.SH PMCD AND ARCHIVE VERSIONS
Since PCP version 2, version information has been associated with
.BR pmcd (1)
and PCP archives. The version number is used in a number of ways,
but most noticeably for the distributed
.BR pmns (4).
In PCP version 1, the client applications would load the PMNS from the
default PMNS file 
but in PCP version 2, the client applications extract the PMNS information from
.BR pmcd (1)
or a PCP archive. 
Thus in PCP version 2, the version number is used to determine if
the PMNS to use is from the default local file or from the actual
current source of the metrics.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables apply to all installations.
.TP
.B PCP_STDERR
Many PCP tools support the environment variable
.BR PCP_STDERR ,
which can be used to
control where error messages are sent.
When unset, the default behavior is that
``usage'' messages and option parsing errors are
reported on standard error, other messages after
initial startup are sent to the default destination for the tool,
i.e. standard error for ASCII tools, or a dialog for GUI tools.
.RS
.PP
If
.B PCP_STDERR
is set to the literal value
.B DISPLAY
then all messages will be displayed in a dialog.
This is used for any tools launched from the IRIX Interactive Desktop\(tm
or from the
.B PerfTools
icon catalog page.
.PP
If
.B PCP_STDERR
is set to any other value, the value is assumed to
be a filename, and all messages will be written there.
.RE
.TP
.B PCP_USE_STDERR
This environment variable, previously used by
.BR pmlaunch (5),
.BR pmgsys (1),
.BR pmview (1)
and the
.BR pmview (1)
front-end scripts (such as
.BR mpvis (1)),
has been deprecated from the PCP 2.0 release onward and replaced by
.BR PCP_STDERR .
.TP
.B PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT
When attempting to connect to a remote
.BR pmcd (1)
on a machine that is booting,
the connection attempt
could potentially block for a long time until the remote machine
finishes its initialization.
Most PCP applications and some of the PCP library routines
will abort and return an error if the connection has not been established after
some specified interval has elapsed.  The default interval is 5
seconds.  This may be modified by setting
.B PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT
in the environment to a real number of seconds for the
desired timeout.
This is most useful in cases where the remote host is at
the end of a slow network, requiring longer latencies to
establish the connection correctly.
.TP
.B PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT
When a monitor or client application loses a connection to a
.BR pmcd (1),
the connection may be re-established by calling
a service routine in the PCP library.
However, attempts to reconnect are controlled by a back-off
strategy to avoid flooding the network with reconnection
requests.
By default, the back-off delays are 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80
seconds for consecutive reconnection requests from a client
(the last delay will be repeated for any further
attempts after the fifth).
Setting the environment variable
.B PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT
to a comma separated list of positive integers will re-define
the back-off delays, e.g. setting
.B PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT
to ``1,2'' will back-off for 1 second, then attempt another
connection request every 2 seconds thereafter.
.TP
.B PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT
For monitor or client applications connected to
.BR pmcd (1),
there is a possibility of the application "hanging" on a request
for performance metrics or metadata or help text.
These delays may become severe if the system
running
.B pmcd
crashes, or the network connection is lost.  By setting the environment
variable
.B PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT
to a real number of seconds, requests to
.B pmcd
will timeout after this number of seconds.  The default behavior is
to be willing to wait 10 seconds for a response from every
.B pmcd
for all applications.
.TP
.B PMCD_WAIT_TIMEOUT
.br
When
.BR pmcd (1)
is started from
.B /etc/init.d/pcp
then the primary instance of
.BR pmlogger (1)
will be started if the configuration flag
.B pmlogger
is chkconfig'ed on, some key applications from the
.I pcp.sw.base
subsystem are installed and
.B pmcd
is running and accepting connections.
.RS
.PP
The check on
.BR pmcd 's
readiness will wait up to
.B PMCD_WAIT_TIMEOUT
seconds.
If
.B pmcd
has a long startup time (such as on a very large
system), then 
.B PMCD_WAIT_TIMEOUT
can be set to provide a maximum wait longer than the default 60 seconds.
.RE
.TP
.B PMNS_DEFAULT
If set, then interpreted as the
the full pathname to be used as the default local PMNS for
.BR pmLoadNameSpace (3).
Otherwise, the default local PMNS is located at
.I /var/pcp/pmns/root
for base PCP installations.
.TP
.B PCP_LOGDIR
Many PCP utilities create diagnostic and trace log files, and the
default locations are below the directory
.IR /var/adm/pcplog .
Setting the environment variable
.B PCP_LOGDIR
will over-ride the default choice of directory.
If
.B PCP_LOGDIR
is unset, the environment variable
.B PCPLOGDIR
will be treated as an alias and used if set (this provides backwards
compatibility with earlier PCP releases).
.TP
.B PCP_COUNTER_WRAP
Many of the performance metrics exported from PCP agents have the
semantics of
.I counter
meaning they are expected to be monotonically increasing.
Under some circumstances, one value of these metrics may smaller
than the previously fetched value.
This can happen when a counter of finite precision overflows, or
when the PCP agent has been reset or restarted, or when the
PCP agent is exporting values from some
underlying instrumentation that is subject to some asynchronous
discontinuity.

The environment variable
.B PCP_COUNTER_WRAP
may be set to indicate that all such cases of a decreasing ``counter''
should be treated
as a counter overflow, and hence the values are assumed to have
wrapped once in the interval between consecutive samples.
This ``wrapping'' behavior was the default in earlier PCP versions, but
by default has been disabled in PCP release from version 1.3 on.
.TP
.BR PCP_LICENCE_NOWARNING " or " PCP_LICENSE_NOWARNING
Many of the PCP client programs require that a valid software license
be present on the host on which the client is running (the license is
node-locked).  In the case that such a valid license is present, but is
due to expire within the next 30 days, a message or popup notifier appears
informing the user of this condition.  These warnings can be disabled
by setting
.BR PCP_LICENCE_NOWARNING " or " PCP_LICENSE_NOWARNING
in the environment.
.TP
.B PMDA_PATH
The
.B PMDA_PATH
environment variable
may be used to modify the search path used by
.BR pmcd (1)
and
.BR pmNewContext (3)
(for
.B PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL
contexts) when searching for a daemon or DSO PMDA.
The syntax follows that for
.B PATH
in
.BR sh (1),
i.e. a colon separated list of directories,
and the default search path is ``/var/pcp/lib:/usr/pcp/lib''.
.TP
.B PMCD_PORT
The TPC/IP port used by
.BR pmcd (1)
to create the socket for incoming connections and requests, is by default
port number 4321.
This may be over-ridden by setting
.B PMCD_PORT
to a different port number.
If a non-default port is used when
.BR pmcd (1)
is started, then
every monitoring application connecting to that
.BR pmcd (1)
must also have
.B PMCD_PORT
set in their environment before attempting a connection.
.PP
The following environment variables are relevant to installations
in which 
.BR pmlogger (1),
the PCP archive logger, is used.
.TP
.B PMLOGGER_PORT
The environment variable
.B PMLOGGER_PORT
may be used to change the base TCP/IP port number used by
.BR pmlogger (1)
to create the socket to which
.BR pmlc (1)
instances will try and connect.
The default base port number is 4330.
When used,
.B PMLOGGER_PORT
should be set in the environment before
.BR pmlogger (1)
