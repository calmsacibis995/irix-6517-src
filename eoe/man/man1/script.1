script \- make typescript of terminal session
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B script
[
.B \-a
] [ file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Script
makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.
The typescript is written to 
.IR file ,
or appended to
.IR file
if the
.B \-a
option is given.
It can be sent to the line printer later with
.IR lp.
If no file name is given, the typescript
is saved in the file
.IR typescript .
.PP
The script ends when the forked shell exits.
.PP
This program is useful when using a crt and a hard-copy
record of the dialog is desired, as for a student handing
in a program that was developed on a crt when hard-copy
terminals are in short supply.
.SH BUGS
.I Script
places 
.B everything
in the log file.  This is not what the naive user expects.
