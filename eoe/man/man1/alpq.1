.SH NAME
\f4alpq\fP \- query the \f4alp\f1 STREAMS module
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4alpq\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4alpq\fP command takes no arguments or options.
It presents, on its standard output,
a list of the functions currently registered
with the \f4alp\fP STREAMS module.
Information on building and using
these functions is contained in the manual entry \f4alp\fP(7).
.PP
The output list contains such entries as
.nf
.sp .8v
         \f41  Ucase    (Upper to lower case converter)\fP
.sp .8v
.fi
.PP
The first field is a sequence number.
The second field is the function's name (by which it may be accessed), and
the third field is the function's explanation string, enclosed in parentheses.
.SH SEE ALSO
kbdcomp(1M),
kbdload(1M),
alp(7),
kbd(7).
.SH NOTES
The \f4alpq\fP command works by pushing the \f4alp\fP
STREAMS
module, querying it via \f4ioctl\fP(2), and then popping it immediately;
its standard input (normally the user's TTY) must
thus be a stream.
