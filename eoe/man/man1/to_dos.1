.SH NAME
to_dos, to_unix \- convert text files between MSDOS and UNIX
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B to_dos
[ <UNIX file> [<MSDOS file>]]
.br
.B to_unix
[ <MSDOS file> [<UNIX file>]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B to_dos
converts a UNIX text file into a MSDOS text file by appending a control-M character at the end of each line and a control-Z character at the end of the file.
.B to_unix
converts a MSDOS text file into a UNIX text file by stripping trailing control-M
and control-Z characters.
.P
Both commands can take zero, one, or two arguments.  If no arguments are
given, the commands act as a filter, taking input from stdin
and writing the modified file to stdout.  When a single argument is 
specified, the argument is treated as the name of the input file, and
the resulting output is written to stdout.  Finally, if two arguments
are provided on the command line, the first argument is treated as
the input file and the second argument is treated as the output file.
.SH EXAMPLES
cat /etc/hosts | to_dos > /dev/ttyd2
.P
to_unix /etc/hosts > /dev/ttyd2
.P
to_dos /etc/hosts /dev/ttyd2
.SH BUGS
Both
.B to_dos
and
.B to_unix
are unable to deal with extremely long lines (> 4K).
