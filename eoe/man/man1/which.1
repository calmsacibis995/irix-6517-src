.RI [ name ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Which
takes a list of names and looks for the files which would be
executed had these names been given as commands.
Each argument is expanded if it is aliased,
and searched for along the user's path.
Aliases are taken from the user's \&.cshrc file.
The current value of path is used.
The
.B \-a
option reports all instances rather than just the first one.
With the
.B \-f
(fast) option,
.I which
ignores the \&.cshrc file.
.SH FILES
.ta 1i
~/\&.cshrc	source of aliases
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
A diagnostic is given for names that are aliased to one or more words,
or if an executable file with the argument name was not found in the path.
.SH BUGS
Must be executed by a csh, since only csh's know about aliases.
Only aliases and paths from ~/.cshrc are used; importing from the current 
environment, \&.login, or /etc/cshrc isn't attempted.
