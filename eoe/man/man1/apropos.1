.SH NAME
apropos \- locate commands by keyword lookup
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f3apropos\f1 keyword ...
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I apropos
shows which manual sections contain instances of any of the given
keywords in their title.
Each word is considered separately, and, case of letters is ignored.
Words that are parts of other words are considered; thus, when looking for
compile,
.I apropos
will also find all instances of compiler.
Try
.IP
apropos password
.PP
and
.IP
apropos editor
.PP
If the line starts `name(section) ...' you can do
`man section name' to get the documentation for it.
Try `apropos format' and then `man 3 printf' to get the manual
on the subroutine
.I printf.
.PP
.I apropos
is actually just the
.B \-k
option to the
.IR man (1)
command.
.SH FILES
.DT
/usr/share/catman/whatis		database
.SH "SEE ALSO"
makewhatis(1M),
man(1),
whatis(1).
.SH CAVEATS
.I apropos
.RI ( "man \-k" )
requires that the
.I whatis
database be kept up to date by running
.IR makewhatis (1M)
after installing or removing software from the system.
If the
.I whatis
database is not kept up to date,
.I apropos
.RI ( "man \-k" )
will not find entries for new manual pages and will erroneously refer to
manual pages that no longer exist on the system.
