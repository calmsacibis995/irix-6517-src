.SH DESCRIPTION
Under certain circumstances, it is useful to be able to modify the values
of performance metrics, for example to re-initialize counters or to assign
new values to metrics that act as control variables.
.PP
.B pmstore
changes the current values for the nominated instances of a
single performance metric, as identified by
.I metricname
and the list of instance identifiers following the
.B \-i
argument.
.I instances
must be a single argument, with
elements of the list separated by commas and/or white space.
By default all
instances of
.I metricname
will be updated.
.PP
Normally
.B pmstore
operates on the default Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however
if the
.B \-n
option is specified an alternative namespace is loaded
from the file
.IR pmnsfile.
.PP
Unless directed to another host by the
.B \-h
option,
.B pmstore
will interact with the Performance Metric Collector Daemon (PMCD)
on the local host.
.PP
The interpretation of
.I value
is dependent on the syntax used in its specification and
the underlying data type of
.IR metricname ,
as follows.
.IP 1. 4
If the metric has an \fBinteger\fR type, then
.I value
should be an optional leading hyphen, followed either by decimal digits
or ``0x'' and some hexadecimal digits.  ``0X'' is also acceptable in lieu
of ``0x''.
See
.BR strtol (3C)
and the related routines.
.IP 2. 4
If the metric has a \fBfloating point\fR type, then
.I value
should be either in the form of an integer described above, or
a fixed point number, or a number in scientific notation.
See
.BR strtod (3C).
.IP 3. 4
If the metric has a \fBstring\fR type, then
.I value
is interpreted as a literal string of ASCII characters.
.IP 4. 4
If the metric has an \fBaggregate\fR type, then an attempt
is made to interpret
.I value
as an integer, else a floating point number, else a string.
In the first two cases, the minimal word length encoding is used, e.g.
``123'' would be interpreted as a 4-byte aggregate, ``0x100000000''
would be interpreted as an 8-byte aggregate.
.PP
The output reports the old value and the new value for each updated
instance of the requested metric.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Two messages indicate a mismatch between the internal data type for
.I metricname
and the
.I value
provided.
.P
The value "???" is out of range for the data type (PM_TYPE_...)
.P
The value "???" is incompatible with the data type (PM_TYPE_...)
