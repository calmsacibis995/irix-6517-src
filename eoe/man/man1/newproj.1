.TH newproj 1
.SH NAME
newproj \- switch to a new project
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3newproj\f1 project [ arguments ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I newproj
changes the user's project identification to \f2project\f1.
The user remains logged in and the current directory is unchanged, but
all process and array session resource accounting will be performed
with respect to the new project.
If the change is successful, the user will be given a new shell.
The original shell, and any processes it may have had running, will
remain alive and associated with the original project.
Thus, exiting the new shell will return the user to the original
shell and original project ID.
.PP
If any arguments are specified on the \f2newproj\f1 command line,
they will be passed along to the program invoked as the new shell.
When using programs like \f2sh\f1(1), an \f2argument\f1 of the
form \f3-c\f1 \f2string\f1 executes \f2string\f1 via the shell and an
\f2argument\f1 of \f3-r\f1 will give the user a restricted shell.
.PP
A list of valid values for \f2project\f1 are contained in the
\f3/etc/projid\f1 file.
If the user is not the superuser, then the user must be authorized
for \f2project\f1 in the \f3/etc/project\f1 file.
