.SH NAME
umask \- set file-creation mode mask
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B umask
[ ooo ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The user file-creation mode mask is set to
.IR ooo .
The three octal digits refer to
read/write/execute permissions for
.IR owner ,
.IR group ,
and
.IR others ,
respectively
(see
.IR chmod (2)
and
.IR umask (2)).
The value of each specified digit is subtracted from the corresponding
``digit'' specified by the system for the creation of a file
(see
.IR creat (2)).
For example,
.B "umask 022"
removes
.I group\^
and
.I others\^
write permission
(files normally created
with mode
.B 777
become mode
.BR 755 ;
files created with mode
.B 666
become mode
.BR 644 ).
.PP
If
.I ooo\^
is omitted, the current value of the mask is printed.
.PP
.I umask\^
is recognized and executed
by the shell.
.PP
\f2umask\f1 can be included in the user's \f3.profile\f1 or \f3.login\f1 file
(see \f2profile\f1(4) and \f2cshrc\f1(4)) and invoked at
login to automatically set the user's permissions on files or directories created.
The default for all logins is set in \f3/etc/default/login\f1 before the
user's shell is started.
