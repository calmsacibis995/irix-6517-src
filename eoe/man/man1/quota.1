.SH NAME
quota \- display disk usage and limits
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B quota
[
.B \-nv
] [
user ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I quota
displays users' disk usage (in kilobytes) and limits. 
Only the super-user may use the optional
.I user
argument to view the limits of another user.
.PP
If a
.B \-n
flag is supplied,
.I quota
will only display user's quotas for local file systems.
Remotely mounted file systems are ignored.
.PP
Normally,
output pertaining to only those filesystems
where the user has exceeded his or her quota is displayed.
The
.B \-v
flag causes
.I quota
to report the user's quotas even if they have not been exceeded.
.PP
.I quota
reports only on file systems which have
disk quotas. 
Remotely mounted file systems which are mounted
with the 
.B noquota
option or without the 
.B quota
option (see
.IR fstab (4))
are ignored.
.SH BUGS
.P
EFS does not keep quota accounting for users who do not have quota limits. 
.P
EFS filesystems do not keep accurate quota accounting when quota limits
are added or removed; 
.IR quotacheck (1M)
must be run to rectify its records.
