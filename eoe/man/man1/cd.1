.SH NAME
cd \- change working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f3cd\f1 [ directory ]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If
.I directory
is not specified, the value of shell parameter
.B $HOME
is used as the new working directory.
If
.I directory
specifies a complete path starting with
.BR / ,
.BR \&. ,
.BR \&.. ,
.I directory
becomes the new working directory.
If neither case applies,
.I cd
tries to find the designated directory relative to one of the
paths specified by the
.B $CDPATH
shell variable.
.B $CDPATH
has the same syntax as, and similar semantics to, the
.B $PATH
shell variable.
.I cd
must have execute (search) permission in
.IR directory .
.PP
Because a new process is created to execute each command,
.I cd
would be ineffective if it were written as a
normal command;
therefore, it is recognized and is internal to
the shell.
