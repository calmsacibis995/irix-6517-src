.SH NAME
delta \- make a delta (change) to an \s-1SCCS\s+1 file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3delta\f1 [\f3\-r \f1SID\f1] [\f3\-s\f1] [\f3\-n\f1]
[\f3\-g \f1list] [\f3\-m mrlist] [\f3\-y\f1[comment]]
[\f3\-p\f1] files
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I delta\^
is used to permanently introduce into
the named \s-1SCCS\s+1 file changes that were made to the file retrieved by
.IR get (1)
(called the
.IR g-file ,
or generated file).
.PP
.I delta\^
makes a delta to each named \s-1SCCS\s+1 file.
If a directory is named,
.I delta\^
behaves as though each file in the directory were
specified as a named file,
except that non-\s-1SCCS\s+1 files
(last component of the path name does not begin with \f3s.\f1)
and unreadable files
are silently ignored.
If a name of \f3\-\f1 is given, the standard input is read
(see \f2\s-1WARNINGS\s+1\f1);
each line of the standard input is taken to be the name of an \s-1SCCS\s+1 file
to be processed.
.PP
.I delta\^
may issue prompts on the standard output depending upon
certain keyletters specified and flags
[see
.IR admin (1)]
that may be
present in the \s-1SCCS\s+1 file
(see
.B \-m
and
.B \-y
keyletters below).
.PP
Keyletter arguments
apply independently
to each named file.
.RS 5
.TP 15
.BI \-r SID
Uniquely
identifies which delta is to be made to the \s-1SCCS\s+1 file.
The use of this keyletter is necessary only if two or more
outstanding
.IR get s
for editing
.RB ( "get \-e" )
on the same \s-1SCCS\s+1 file were done by the same person
(login name).
The \s-1SID\s+1 value specified with the
.B \-r
keyletter can be either the \s-1SID\s+1 specified on the
.I get\^
command line or the \s-1SID\s+1 to be made as reported by the
.I get\^
command
[see
.IR get (1)].
A diagnostic results if the specified \s-1SID\s+1 is ambiguous, or,
if necessary and omitted on the command line.
.TP 15
.BI \-s
Suppresses
the issue, on the standard output, of the created delta's \s-1SID\s+1,
as well as the number of lines inserted, deleted and unchanged in the
\s-1SCCS\s+1 file.
.TP 15
.B \-n
Specifies retention of the edited
.I g-file\^
(normally removed at completion of delta processing).
.TP 15
.BI \-g list
a \f2list\f1 (see
.IR get (1)
for the definition of \f2list\f1)
of deltas which are to be
.I ignored\^
when the file is accessed at the change level (\s-1SID\s+1)
created by this delta.
.TP 15
.BI \-m [mrlist]
If the \s-1SCCS\s+1 file has the
.B v
flag set
[see
.IR admin (1)]
then a Modification Request (\f3\s-1MR\s+1\f1) number \f2must\f1 be
supplied as the reason for creating the new delta.
.IP
If
.B \-m
is not used and the standard input is a terminal, the prompt
.SM
.B MR\*Ss?
is issued on the standard output before the standard input
is read; if the standard input is not a terminal, no prompt is issued.
The
.SM
.B MR\*Ss?
prompt always precedes the
.B comments?
prompt
(see
.B \-y
keyletter).
.IP
\f3\s-1MR\s+1\f1s
in a list are separated by blanks and/or tab characters.
An unescaped new-line character terminates the \f3\s-1MR\s+1\f1 list.
.IP
Note that if the
.B v
flag has a value
[see
.IR admin (1)],
it is taken to be the name of a program (or shell procedure) which will validate
the correctness of the \f3\s-1MR\s+1\f1 numbers.
If a non-zero exit status is returned from
the \f3\s-1MR\s+1\f1 number validation program,
.I delta\^
terminates.
(It is assumed that the \f3\s-1MR\s+1\f1 numbers were not all valid.)
.TP 15
.BI \-y [comment]
Arbitrary text
used to describe the reason for making the delta.
A null string is considered a valid \f2comment\f1.
.IP
If
.B \-y
is not specified and the standard input is a terminal, the prompt
.B comments?
is issued on the standard output before the standard
input is read; if the standard input is not a terminal, no
prompt is issued.
An unescaped new-line character terminates the comment text.
.TP 15
.B \-p
Causes
.I delta\^
to print (on the standard output) the \s-1SCCS\s+1 file
differences before and after the delta is applied
in a
.IR diff (1)
format.

.SH WARNINGS
Lines beginning with an \s-1\f3SOH\fP ASCII\s+1 character (binary 001)
cannot be placed in the \s-1SCCS\s+1 file unless the
.SM
.B SOH
is escaped.
This character has special meaning to \s-1SCCS\s+1
[see
\f2sccsfile\f1(4)
(5)] and will cause an error.
.PP
A
.I get\^
of many \s-1SCCS\s+1 files,
followed by a
.I delta\^
of those files, should be avoided when the
.I get\^
generates a large amount of data.
Instead,
multiple
.I "get/delta\^"
sequences should be used.
.PP
If the standard input
(\f3\-\f1)
is specified on the
.I delta\^
command line,
the
.B \-m
(if necessary)
and
.B \-y
keyletters
.I must\^
also be present.
Omission of these keyletters causes an error to occur.
.PP
Comments are limited to text strings of at most 512 characters.
