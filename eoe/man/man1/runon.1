.SH NAME
runon \- run a command on a particular cpu
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B runon
n command [ arguments ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I runon\^
executes
.I command\^,
assigning it to run only on cpu \f2n\fP,
where \f2n\fP varies between 0 and the number of processors
on the system minus one.
(For single-processor systems, then, there is only cpu 0.)
.PP
This cpu affinity is inherited across \f2fork()\fP and
\f2exec()\fP system calls.
A \f2sysmp(2)\fP call can change the cpu affinity.
Note that \f2command\fP may still run on other processors, briefly,
to perform i/o or other hardware-specific actions.
.PP
.I runon\^ 
can not run a command on a cpu that is part of a cpuset unless
the user has permission to access the cpuset.

.SH SEE ALSO
mpadmin(1), sysmp(2), miser_cpuset(1).
