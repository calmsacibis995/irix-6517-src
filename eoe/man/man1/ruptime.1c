.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ruptime
gives a status line like
.I uptime
for each machine on the local network;
these are formed from packets broadcast by each host
on the network every three minutes.
.PP
Machines for which no
status report has been received for 11 minutes are shown as being down.
.PP
Users idle an hour or more are not counted unless the
.B \-a
flag is given.
.PP
Normally, the listing is sorted by host name.
The
.B \-l ,
.B \-t ,
and
.B \-u
flags specify sorting by
load average,
uptime,
and number of users, respectively.
The
.B \-r
flag reverses the sort order.
