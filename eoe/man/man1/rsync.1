.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rsync
synchronize RCS working files with the top revisions in their
version files.
The option
.B \\-v
causes more verbose output.  If given twice, each directory name
is printed as it is encountered.
The option
.BI \\-r rcsdir
specifies the name of RCS
subdirectories.
The default is "RCS".
The option
.BI \\-c cmd
causes
.I cmd
to be used instead of the
default
.IR co .
The option
.B \\-R
causes
.I rsync\^
to descend and synchronize
the entire subtree below
each specified directory.
.PP
For each RCS file discovered,
if the corresponding working
file (in the parent directory,
with the RCS ,v suffix stripped)
is either missing, or is both
older and smaller, then
.B rsync\^
checks out a top of trunk revision.
.PP
Subdirectories with names ending in ".skip"
or named "old" are skipped.
.PP
While examining RCS files,
.B rsync\^
also emits warnings in the cases
of working files that are writable
but not locked, of working files
writable by group or other, and
of working files that are larger
than the corresponding RCS ,v file.
