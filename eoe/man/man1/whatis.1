command ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I whatis

.IR man (1)
command to get more information.
If the line starts `name(section) ...' you can do
`man section name' to get the documentation for it.
Try `whatis ed' and then you should do `man 1 ed' to get the manual.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
apropos(1), man(1), makewhatis(1M).
.SH CAVEATS
.I whatis
.RI ( "man \-f" )
requires that the
.I whatis
database be kept up to date by running
.IR makewhatis (1M)
after installing or removing software from the system.
If the
.I whatis
database is not kept up to date,
.I whatis
.RI ( "man \-f" )
will not find entries for new manual pages and will erroneously refer to
manual pages which no longer exist on the system.
