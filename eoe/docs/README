This is the irix ism internal document directory.
The documents in this tree are for internal SGI use.
User documents reside in the man and book directories.

Technical writers can use the documentation in this directory
to write the real User's Manuals (books).

To expedite document searches, the tree below this directory
replicates the tree structure of the irix directory, placing
the documents where in the irix tree you'd find code.

For instance, the documents for the NUMA kernel module are
placed in irix/docs/kern/os/numa.
